"""Every guarantee, proven able to FAIL.

A test that has never failed is a decoration. For each registered guarantee this
script breaks the thing the guarantee guards, runs that guarantee's tests in a
fresh interpreter, and requires them to go RED. If a test stays green with its
subject broken, it was not measuring its subject and this script says so.

    python scripts/fail_controls.py            # every control
    python scripts/fail_controls.py F3 F8      # a subset
    python scripts/fail_controls.py --anchors  # anchors only, in a second
    python scripts/fail_controls.py --pin      # the control ids against their pin

**The anchor pre-flight.** `--anchors` counts every plant's `from` string in its
file without running a single test. An anchor is a string in a source file, and
editing the line it sits on silently retires the control that depends on it --
five of another repo's ten dead controls were killed exactly that way, by a fix
round that edited the anchor lines. The pre-flight answers that whole failure
mode in a second where the full run takes a minute, and run against an older tree
it is its own positive control.

**Restores are written back, never `git checkout`.** Each plant is a context
manager whose `finally` writes the original bytes and verifies them. `checkout`
has been broken twice on this project and would take a co-resident session's
uncommitted work with it.
