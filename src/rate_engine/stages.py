"""The pipeline's stages, in order, and what each one is for.

Settled in OPENPARKING_SETTLED §8. Several rates can be live on one stay at
once, so this is not "pick one" -- a stay runs through every stage and each may
add lines to the ledger.

    QUALIFY    which base applies: increments, or a special that beats them
    ACCUMULATE the time-based charge itself
    CAP        daily and weekly maxima
    SURCHARGE  a space class costing more than the base (VIP, reserved)
    ADJUST     occupancy-driven multipliers

The order is load-bearing and is not a detail of this implementation: a cap that
ran before the surcharge would cap a number the customer is not being charged,
and a surcharge applied before the cap would be silently capped away.

Every stage now carries at least one rule type. ADJUST was empty in A1 and went
live in A2 with `time_window`'s `adjust` effect -- a percentage or an amount, up
or down, on the whole fee. It runs LAST, which is the same argument the order
above rests on: an adjustment applied before the cap and the surcharge would take
a percentage of a number the customer is not being charged.

# --- what happens when TWO rules qualify at one stage ----------------------
#
# **Not one answer, three, and treating it as one was a live defect.**
# `find_conflicts` refused whenever more than one rule qualified at ANY stage.
# That is right at QUALIFY, where two specials are competing bases and only one
# can be the price. It is wrong everywhere else -- and the moment `weekly_max`
# exists it is catastrophically wrong, because every plan carrying a daily AND a
# weekly cap would refuse every stay in the garage. Two caps are not a
# contradiction; they are two ceilings, and the lower one wins.

#: Two qualifying rules are a genuine either/or: only one of them can be the
#: base, and the PLAN says which. This is the stage set the resolution modes act
#: on, and the only one they can act on -- a mode stated for a stage that cannot
#: resolve is a decision that does nothing.
RESOLVING: frozenset[str] = frozenset({QUALIFY, ACCUMULATE})

#: All of them apply, and the order they are applied in cannot change the total.
#: Two caps in sequence leave the lower ceiling standing whichever runs first,
#: which falls out of what a cap IS rather than being arranged. The LINES differ
#: by order, so they are emitted in ascending rule id -- deterministic, and never
#: the caller's array position, which decided money in this module once already.
COMPOSING_ORDER_INDEPENDENT: frozenset[str] = frozenset({CAP, SURCHARGE})

#: All of them apply, and the order DOES change the total: 20% off then $5 off is
#: not $5 off then 20% off. So when more than one qualifies the plan must state
#: their order, and a plan that does not is refused naming them. The engine will
#: not pick, for the same reason it will not pick between two specials.
COMPOSING_ORDER_DEPENDENT: frozenset[str] = frozenset({ADJUST})

#: Every stage is in exactly one category. Asserted at import rather than left as
#: a comment: a stage added to STAGES and to none of the sets below would fall
#: through `find_conflicts` silently, which is how a stage stops being checked.
