"""Money is a Python ``int`` of minor units. Nothing else is money here.

A float, a bool or a ``Decimal`` is refused at ANY depth of a plan or a rule --
by ``refuse_non_integer_money``, whether or not the field is one this version
reads. A string is refused wherever money is expected, by ``as_minor``; strings
are of course ordinary elsewhere in a plan. A rate that cannot be expressed in
minor units is a rate this module refuses, and it refuses it at load rather than
at the point the arithmetic goes wrong.

Three traps this file exists to close, all of them things that pass a naive
``isinstance(value, int)``:

* **``bool`` is a subclass of ``int`` in Python.** ``isinstance(True, int)`` is
  ``True``, so ``True`` sails through an integer check and then prices a stay at
  one minor unit. It is rejected explicitly, first, before the int check.
* **JSON exponent form parses to a float.** ``json.loads("1e2")`` is ``100.0``,
  not ``100`` -- a plan author writing ``1e2`` for a dollar rate produces a float
  that happens to be integral. ``float`` is rejected whatever its value, so
  ``100.0`` is refused exactly as ``100.5`` is. There is no "but it is a whole
  number" branch, because that branch is how floats get in.
* **``Decimal`` looks like the safe choice and is not, here.** It is refused too.
  Not because it is inaccurate -- it is not -- but because two money types in
  one codebase means every function has to handle both, and the one that
  eventually forgets is the one that ships. One type, all the way down.

Nothing in this module rounds money, and that half of the sentence has always
been true. **There are TWO time roundings, and only one of them is stated per
rule** -- the original wording claimed only one existed and that the plan decided
it, which was false in the direction that costs money:

* **A part-minute is a whole minute.** ``engine.Stay.duration_minutes`` rounds a
  partial minute UP before any rule sees the stay. This is ASSUMED, module-wide,
  and no plan field reaches it. It is the ordinary garage convention and it is
  kept -- but it is a pricing decision, so it is stated here rather than left to
  be discovered. A stay of 09:00:00 to 09:01:00.001 is TWO minutes, and on a rule
  with one-minute periods that is twice the fee.
* **Minutes into periods is STATED PER RULE**, by ``increment.rounding``, and the
  applier refuses a mode it does not implement rather than pricing under another.

The second is what "stated per rule" was ever true of. Both happen before any
amount is touched, so no money is rounded either way.

**Where the first one is visible, and it is not only cosmetic:** a stated ceiling
is compared against the SAME rounded value the rules price on, so a stay of
24 hours and one millisecond is 1441 minutes and a 1440-minute ceiling does not
cover it -- the stay is REFUSED rather than priced. That is coherent, and it is
the behaviour §8 asks for (nothing prices it, so the owner is asked), but an
operator reading "the only rounding is time into periods" would not have predicted
it. See ``rules/increment.py`` and ``engine.Stay.duration_minutes``.

    **This function used to be called `refuse_floats`, and the old name was the

    Four published sites nevertheless said "a float, a bool or a Decimal anywhere
    in a plan is refused at load" -- docs/CONTRACT.md twice, README.md, and this
    module's own header. Measured: a bool and a Decimal were ACCEPTED at every
    one of the four `decisions[]` fields, which are the only leaves in a plan
    that no other check types.

    Every individual F4 test was true. The sentence over them was not, and the
    fix is to make the sentence true rather than to narrow it -- so the walk now
    refuses all three, and the name says which three.

    ``as_minor`` guards the fields the engine reads. This guards the fields it
    does not -- a float sitting in a rule parameter the current version ignores
    is a float that starts being read the round somebody adds the rule type that
    reads it, and by then it is in a plan an operator believes is live.

    The check is on the type, not on the value: ``3.0`` is refused. A plan is
    data an integrator wrote, and the moment this makes an exception for a float
    that happens to be whole, every float becomes one bug away from whole.
