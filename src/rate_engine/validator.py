"""`validate-plan`: every gap and every conflict, before a stay ever arrives.

Same mechanism as the engine's refusal -- literally the same two functions,
``engine.find_gaps`` and ``engine.find_conflicts`` -- run over a matrix of probe
stays instead of one real one. That is what makes the promise in R5 structural: a
gap the validator reports and a gap the engine refuses on are the same object
with the same identifier, because there is one implementation and the validator
is the thing calling it repeatedly.

**The probe matrix is DERIVED from the plan, not written down.** A fixed list of
scenarios can only find the gaps whoever wrote the list already thought of. So
the probes are built from the plan's own thresholds -- every rule's period
lengths, every stated ceiling, every window limit -- with a stay either side of
each. A plan whose ceiling is 24 hours gets probed at 24h and at 24h+1m whatever
those numbers are, because they are read out of the rules.

**THREE axes, and the third arrived with `time_window`.** The README says, in as
many words, that a rule type qualifying on something it does not declare as a
time or a duration "would need its own probe axis, and adding one is part of
adding the rule type". `time_window` qualifies on the DAY, so the day is an axis
now: every probe used to enter on one fixed Tuesday, and two weekend rules that
conflict with each other would have gone unreported exactly the way the two dawn
rules did before entry became an axis. That is the same defect in a new place,
and it is closed here rather than left for the next outside pass to find.
