"""Gaps and conflicts: ONE registry, read by the validator and by the engine.

A gap is a stay the plan cannot price. A conflict is two rules qualifying at one
stage whose resolution the plan does not state. The validator reports them so an
owner can decide; the engine REFUSES on them so a stay is never priced by a
guess. Those are two behaviours of one mechanism, and the whole point of this
file is that they cannot drift apart -- both sides key off the identifiers
below, and ``tests/test_f1_never_guesses.py`` requires every identifier here to
be reachable from a fixture.

**Keyed by identifier, never matched by substring.** A validator that reported
"nothing prices a stay past 24 hours" and an engine that refused with a
differently-worded sentence would agree to a human reader and to no test. The
sentence is for the operator; ``code`` is what anything mechanical uses.

# --- gap codes -------------------------------------------------------------
#: The stay's space class is not one the plan declares.
GAP_UNDECLARED_SPACE_CLASS = "GAP_UNDECLARED_SPACE_CLASS"
#: Nothing accumulates time for this stay: no ACCUMULATE rule covers the space
#: class, and no QUALIFY special took over the pricing.
GAP_NO_ACCUMULATE_RULE = "GAP_NO_ACCUMULATE_RULE"
#: An ACCUMULATE rule covers the space class but states a maximum duration this
#: stay exceeds. This is §8's own example -- "nothing prices a stay past 24
#: hours" -- and it is expressible only because `max_duration_minutes` is a
#: required field on the rule rather than an assumed infinity.
GAP_STAY_EXCEEDS_MAX_DURATION = "GAP_STAY_EXCEEDS_MAX_DURATION"
#: No plan version was in force at the stay's ENTRY time.
GAP_NO_PLAN_IN_FORCE_AT_ENTRY = "GAP_NO_PLAN_IN_FORCE_AT_ENTRY"
#: No tax set the garage stated was in force at the instant the tax was asked
#: for. REFUSED, never taxed at zero: a garage with no set in force at that
#: instant has not said "no tax" there -- it has said nothing -- and zero is a
#: tax position somebody would have had to state. Stating "no tax" is a set with
#: no rules, which is a statement; see tax.py.
#:
#: Not reported by `validate-plan`, which validates a PLAN, and a tax set is the
#: garage's rather than a plan's. F1 reaches it from a tax fixture.
GAP_NO_TAX_SET_IN_FORCE = "GAP_NO_TAX_SET_IN_FORCE"

# --- conflict codes --------------------------------------------------------
#: **`CONFLICT_MULTIPLE_RULES_AT_STAGE` was removed in schema version 4.** It
#: named two rules qualifying at a RESOLVING stage that the plan could not
#: settle, and after A2 the only such case left was a tie at the cheapest charge
#: under `cheapest_wins`. U7g prices that tie -- the driver pays the same either
#: way -- so nothing could produce the code any more, and a registered code
#: nothing can produce is a promise with no mechanism behind it. See
#: docs/CONTRACT.md, "What changed in version 4".
#: Two or more plan versions share the latest `effective_from` at or before the
#: stay's entry, so "the version in force at entry" names more than one document.
#:
#: This was a LIVE DEFECT, not a hypothetical. `select_plan` used
#: `max(in_force, key=...effective_from)`, and `max` returns the FIRST maximal
#: element -- so two versions carrying the same date priced the same car at 300
#: or at 2700 minor units depending only on which the caller happened to put
#: first in a JSON array, with nothing said. Deciding money by the order of a
#: list, silently, is the exact opposite of this project's standing acceptance,
#: and the answer is the same as everywhere else here: refuse, and name both.
CONFLICT_AMBIGUOUS_PLAN_SELECTION = "CONFLICT_AMBIGUOUS_PLAN_SELECTION"

#: The rules between them produced a NEGATIVE total. Refused rather than handing a
#: customer a negative amount.
#:
#: It used to be raised as CONFLICT_MULTIPLE_RULES_AT_STAGE (removed in version
#: 4), which was documented exclusively for two rules qualifying at one stage.
#: Nothing was mispriced -- the refusal is correct and the SENTENCE said what
#: really happened -- but the CODE named a cause that had not occurred, and the
#: code is what anything mechanical keys off. A consumer routing on it would
#: have told an operator to settle a resolution order that was not the problem.
#:
#: Every money field goes through `as_non_negative_minor`, and a cap reduces the
#: total to a ceiling that is never below zero (`daily_max`: `max_minor x days`;
#: `weekly_max`: the sum of its weeks' ceilings). A fixed discount takes off at
#: most the running total, and nothing once the total is at or below zero, so it
#: never adds money. This said "unreachable" while a fixed discount larger
#: than a short stay's charge reached it, and that stay was refused rather than
#: priced at zero. A percentage discount is still not limited: one over 100%
#: reaches this refusal, and a fixed discount after it does not undo that (a
#: limit with no floor once turned 150% then 5.00 off into a priced stay with a
#: discount line adding 1.50). It is registered either way because a rule type is the
#: unit of growth here, and the first one that can return a negative Line should
#: meet a named refusal rather than a mislabelled one.
CONFLICT_NEGATIVE_TOTAL = "CONFLICT_NEGATIVE_TOTAL"

#: Two or more ADJUST rules qualify and the plan does not say in what order to
#: apply them.
#:
#: This is a DIFFERENT question from two rules qualifying at QUALIFY, which is
#: "which one is the price" -- an either/or the plan always settles with its
#: resolution mode. Two adjustments is not
#: an either/or at all: BOTH apply, and the only open question is the sequence.
#: 20% off then 5.00 off is not 5.00 off then 20% off, and the difference is
#: money, so the engine will not pick -- for the same reason it will not pick
#: between two specials.
#:
#: Caps and surcharges raise no such question: they compose in any order and the
#: total is the same, which is why CAP and SURCHARGE are order-INDEPENDENT and
#: two of them together are not reported at all.
CONFLICT_UNORDERED_ADJUSTMENTS = "CONFLICT_UNORDERED_ADJUSTMENTS"

#: A plan carries a fill rule covering this stay's space class, and the stay
#: arrived without `occupancy_at_entry_bp`. The rule prices on how full the
#: garage was when the car came in, and with no figure there is nothing to read:
#: the stay is refused rather than priced as if the garage were empty or full.
#: A plan with no fill rule never asks for the figure.
GAP_NO_OCCUPANCY_AT_ENTRY = "GAP_NO_OCCUPANCY_AT_ENTRY"

#: Two fill rules covering one space class both qualify for a stay. They are two
#: answers to the same question -- how much more the time costs when the garage
#: is full -- and `adjust_order` cannot settle it, because an order would charge
#: both. The plan states one rule per class.
CONFLICT_OVERLAPPING_FILL_RULES = "CONFLICT_OVERLAPPING_FILL_RULES"

# --- fault codes -----------------------------------------------------------
#: A registered rule type returned something that is not a list of Lines.
#:
#: This is a THIRD kind, and it is deliberately not filed under the other two.
#: A gap is a stay the plan cannot price and a conflict is two rules the plan
#: does not order -- both are questions for the OWNER, and both are things
#: `validate-plan` reports. This is neither: it is a defect in a rule type's
#: implementation, which no owner can decide and no plan can fix. Filing it as a
#: conflict would have been the same mistake the negative-fee refusal makes --
#: a refusal whose code names something that did not happen.
