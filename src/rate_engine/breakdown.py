"""The breakdown, and the reason the fee cannot disagree with it.

The first requirement of this module is clarity: an operator gets the number AND
the plain-English reason for every part of it, including the specials that did
NOT apply and why. So the breakdown is not a report written alongside the
calculation -- it IS the calculation.

**A LEDGER, NOT A SUM.** The brief said "the fee is the sum of the lines" and its
own worked example did not sum:

    ... total 4400 · Daily max 3000 applied · Fee 3000

4400 + 3000 is not 3000. A CAP is not additive: it replaces. Stating the rule as
a plain sum forces every capping rule to either lie in its line or live outside
the ledger, and the second of those is the two-code-paths defect the rule existed
to prevent. So each line carries a SIGNED DELTA and the fee is the running total.
The same example, priced honestly:

    Time-based: first hour 800                              +800
    Time-based: 9 additional hours at 400                  +3600
    Daily max 3000 applied                                 -1400
                                                    fee =  3000

Every line's text describes its own delta, the deltas add to the fee by
construction, and a cap that reduces a total says by how much -- which is the
number an operator actually wants to see and the plain sum would have hidden.

**There is exactly one way for a rule to change the fee: return a Line.** No rule
receives the running total to mutate, and the engine has no adjustment channel of
its own. That is what makes F8 a structural property rather than a comparison
between two copies of the same claim -- see ``engine.quote``, which asserts the
invariant on every quote, and ``tests/test_f8_breakdown_adds_up.py``, which
plants a second path and requires red.
