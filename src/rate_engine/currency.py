"""ISO 4217, only as far as this module needs it: which codes are money, and how
many minor units each has in a major one.

**Why this file exists.** `format_minor` did `divmod(abs(minor), 100)` for every
currency, so a fee of 800 minor units in a zero-decimal currency was returned
correctly as 800 and RENDERED as "8.00" -- the number right, the sentence a
hundred times wrong, in the breakdown that is the whole product. And the plan
loader's own diagnostic said "a three-letter uppercase ISO 4217 code" while it
checked only shape, so `ZZZ` loaded happily.

Those were one defect, and this is one fix: the exponent is a property of the
currency, so the module has to know the currency to render the money.

**Why the plan does not declare its own exponent.** It was the cheaper option and
it is wrong: the number of minor units in a yen is a fact the world already
fixed, and putting it on the plan invites an operator to state it incorrectly --
a wrong exponent silently multiplies every rendered amount by a hundred. A fact
nobody may vary does not belong in a document somebody writes.

**What is REFUSED, and why refusal is the right answer.** A code this table does
not carry cannot be rendered, because rendering needs the exponent. Refusing at
load is the same disposition as everywhere else in this module: say what is
missing rather than guess a value. That makes the loader's existing diagnostic
TRUE instead of retiring it.

**EXCLUSIONS ARE STATED AND CHECKED, NEVER LEFT AS ABSENCE.** They used to be a
paragraph of prose plus a code simply not appearing in the table -- which is an
OMISSION wearing a decision's clothes: nothing distinguished "we decided not to
price in this" from "we forgot it", and a prose range like "`XBA`-`XBD`" is not an
enumeration, so `XBB` and `XBC` were named by nobody. The sets below are the
decision, `REFUSED_BY_DECISION` is asserted disjoint from the table, and
`excluded_reason` puts the reason in the operator's refusal.

**THIS TABLE IS TRANSCRIBED, NOT DERIVED, AND IT IS THE ONLY ONE IN THE REPO.**
There is no dependency to read the register from and CI has no network, so it is
typed -- which this project's rules otherwise forbid. Two consequences, both
deliberate: `tests/test_f17_currency_is_rendered_by_its_exponent.py` asserts the
STRUCTURE (every value is a real ISO exponent, every key is well-formed, the
non-two groups are exactly the sets below), and an omission fails LOUDLY at load
rather than rendering wrongly -- so the failure mode of an incomplete table is a
refused plan somebody reports, never a wrong amount somebody pays.
