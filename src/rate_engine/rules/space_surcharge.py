"""`space_surcharge` -- base plus a fixed amount, or a percent, for a space class.

§8's consequence, and it is the reason this rule type exists in A1 at all: **the
module prices a SPACE, not a garage.** A VIP area and a reserved spot are the
same mechanism -- a class of space that costs the base plus a stated amount --
and so is the nested-area pricing a later round will need. Getting the space
identifier onto the contract from day one is most of that work.

It runs AFTER the cap, deliberately. A surcharge applied before the cap would be
capped away, so the customer would pay the same for a VIP space as for a standard
one on any stay long enough to hit the maximum -- which is not what an operator
who charges extra for VIP means. See stages.py: the order is load-bearing.

A stay in a space class this rule does not cover produces NO line. That is the
one place in this module where a non-qualifying rule stays silent, and it is
deliberate: a standard-space receipt listing every VIP tier the garage does not
charge for is noise, not clarity. A rule that could have applied to THIS space
and did not is a different thing and does emit a line.

**Two forms, one rule type.** A flat amount per stay, `surcharge_minor`, as it has
always been; or a PERCENT of the stay's time-based charge, `amount: {kind:
"percent", percent_bp}` with its `rounding` (10-14: "we will need to do %"). The
percent is taken of the charge for the TIME -- the running total when SURCHARGE
began, after the base and the caps (`ON_THE_TIME_CHARGE`) -- and never of another
surcharge, so two surcharges still compose in any order with the same total.
A rule states one form or the other, never both.
