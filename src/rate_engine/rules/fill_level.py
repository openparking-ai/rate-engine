"""`fill_level` -- when the garage is at least X% full, the time costs Y% more.

His rule, 2026-10-13: occupancy-based pricing is wanted, and "all the cars inside
are old price". So the figure this rule reads is how full the garage was **at the
moment the car came in** -- `Stay.occupancy_at_entry_bp`, set by the caller when
the stay opened -- and nothing about a stay's price changes after entry. "Full"
is every car inside against every switched-on space (10-14: "all cars"); the
engine does not count anything, it reads the figure it is handed.

**It runs at ADJUST**, the stage stages.py has always described as the place for
occupancy-driven multipliers, and **it raises the charge for the TIME**: the
running total when SURCHARGE began, after whichever base priced the stay and after
the caps (`ON_THE_TIME_CHARGE`), **less any discount taken before it** (10-14
20:25, "always the cheaper"): 10.00 with 20% or 2.00 off at a +20% fill rule is
8.00 + 1.60 = 9.60. Which order and which split of the discount between the
time charge and the extra is not argued here: the engine prices every order and
charges the cheapest, to the cent (`engine._adjusted`, F55), and this rule is
told what is left of each part on the order being priced. The plan loader still
holds every fill rule LAST in `adjust_order`.

**Two answers the OWNER gives, and the engine assumes neither** (2026-10-14: the
owner decides, at rate setup for dynamic pricing). Both are required, answered
`"yes"` or `"no"`, with no default, and a plan that omits either does not load.
They are words and not JSON booleans because no bool appears anywhere in a plan
(F4): a bool is an int in Python, one cent away from money.

* `raises_specials` -- when a special priced the time (a window with a `flat` or
  `rate` effect that qualified), is that charge raised too? `no`: it is not,
  and a line says so in plain words. Under `cheapest_wins` the stay is still
  priced both ways, so a car a special can price pays the cheaper of the unraised
  special and the raised time-based rate.
* `raises_vip_extra` -- is what SURCHARGE added for the stay's space class (flat
  or percent) raised by the same percent? `yes`: it gets its own line, rounded
  the rule's way. `no`: the extra stays as set.

`threshold_bp` and the stay's figure are basis points of full: 80% is 8000. The
rule qualifies AT the threshold and above. A stay with no figure, in a class this
rule covers, never reaches the applier: `find_gaps` refuses it by name
(`NEEDS_OCCUPANCY`). Below the threshold the rule SPEAKS -- "why was I not
charged the busy rate" and "why was I" are the same question -- and a class the
rule does not cover stays silent, as every rule outside QUALIFY does.
