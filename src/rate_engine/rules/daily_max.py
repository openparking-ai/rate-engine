"""`daily_max` -- a cap, and the rule that forced the timezone model to be real.

A cap is not additive: it replaces a bigger number with a smaller one. In the
ledger it is a NEGATIVE line saying how much it took off, which both keeps the
fee equal to the sum of its lines and shows the operator the size of the
discount -- the number a plain "daily max applied" would have hidden.

**`day_boundary` is required, with no default, and it is the interesting field.**
"Daily max 30" does not say what a day is, and the two honest answers price a
two-day stay differently:

* `calendar_day` -- a day is a local calendar date. A stay from Friday 22:00 to
  Saturday 02:00 is in two of them. Across a DST transition a calendar day is 23
  or 25 hours, and that is correct: a day is what the local clock says it is.
* `rolling_24h` -- a day is 24 hours from ENTRY. The same stay is four hours long
  and is in one. DST does not move it, because 24 hours is 24 hours whatever the
  clock did.

§8 raises exactly this ("what happens at midnight on a two-day stay") as one of
the things a rate sign does not tell you. So the engine does not decide it. A
plan that does not state `day_boundary` does not load.

**Each day is capped on its own (F59).** Gokhan, 2026-10-16: the daily max is
per calendar day -- split the stay at the garage's local midnight and cap each
day by itself. The stay is cut at the start of each of its days, the charge for
the time is split by the day it was charged in, and each day pays at most the
max. Monday 09:00 to Tuesday 00:15 at $8 the first hour and $4 an hour after,
$30 a day: Monday's fifteen hours are $64 and pay $30, Tuesday's fifteen minutes
are the stay's sixteenth hour and pay $4. $34, where a cap of $30 times the days
touched allowed $60. A rolling day is cut at each 24 hours from entry and capped
the same way.

How the charge is split is the base's to say, not this file's: the engine hands
a cap `charged_by` (the `told_the_base` trait), what the base charges for the
stay's first so many minutes. A time-based rate charges a period on the day the
period starts, and does not start again at midnight. A type that does not
say how its charge builds up -- `charged_by` None -- is capped as one price for
the stay, at the max times the days the car is in: the cap cannot know where
its charge fell. A flat special is one: one price for the stay it covers, never
split by the day (F63, Gokhan 2026-10-17). A $50 flat is held to $30 on a
Saturday alone and stands over Friday to Sunday, where the three days allow
$90; the engine then charges the cheaper of it and the time-based rate's whole
stay.

**A day the car is in for no time is not a day it touched.** An exit at exactly
local midnight ends on the date before, so Monday 09:00 to Tuesday 00:00 is one
calendar day, not two. A rolling window already counted that way: a stay of
exactly 24 hours is one window.

**A long stay is priced in the memory of a short one (F61).** Each day is capped
on its own, so a cap walks the stay a day at a time and its work grows with the
days in the stay. Its memory does not. The days are found as they are walked and
never listed, each day's amount goes into a running tally (`Amounts`) rather
than a list, and the cap's line spells out at most `RUNS_SPELLED_OUT` runs of
equal amounts, then says how many more there were and what they came to. As
first written this listed every day of the stay, once for each daily cap and
again inside the weekly cap, so a quote's memory grew with the stay as well as
its time. The engine refuses a stay longer than 90 days before a cap is asked
(F62), so no cap walks more than 90 days. A quote still caps the stay once for
each way of pricing it (F63, F64).
