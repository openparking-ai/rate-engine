"""`weekly_max` -- a cap on the week, and `daily_max`'s shape one unit up.

§8 names it in Gokhan's own list of rate types, beside the daily maximum. It is
the same mechanism: a ceiling on the running total, expressed in the ledger as a
NEGATIVE line saying how much it took off, so the fee stays equal to the sum of
its lines and the operator sees the size of the reduction rather than a bare
"cap applied".

**`week_boundary` is required with no default, for exactly `daily_max`'s
reason.** "Weekly max 100" does not say what a week is, and the two honest
answers price a Saturday-to-Tuesday stay differently:

* `calendar_week` -- the cap is per local week the stay touches, and the week
  starts on the day the plan names. There is no universal answer to which day
  that is: it is Monday in most of Europe, Sunday in the United States, and
  Saturday in parts of the Middle East. The engine will not pick.
* `rolling_7d` -- the cap is per seven days from ENTRY. The starting day is
  irrelevant, so `week_starts_on` is `null` and the null has to be TYPED.

**`week_starts_on` is required in BOTH cases**, the way `max_duration_minutes`
is: null is a statement, and a field that may be absent is a field somebody can
forget while believing they set it.

**TWO caps on one plan are not a conflict.** They compose, and the lower ceiling
wins -- which falls out of applying them in sequence rather than being arranged,
and is why CAP is a composing stage rather than a resolving one. See stages.py:
`find_conflicts` used to refuse whenever more than one rule qualified anywhere,
so this rule type's arrival would have made every plan carrying a daily AND a
weekly cap refuse every stay in the garage.

**Each week is capped on its own, after the daily max for each of its days.**
The week follows the daily max's calendar logic (F59): the stay is cut at its
week boundaries -- a `calendar_week` at local midnight on the day the plan
names, a `rolling_7d` every seven days from entry, both as before -- and each
week pays what the time in it was charged, with each of its days capped by the
plan's daily max, or the weekly max where that is less. Seven days and an hour
at $8 then $4 an hour, $30 a day and $100 a week, is $100 for the first week
and $4 for the hour. This reads the daily caps' terms from the plan, never their
lines, and works from the base rather than the running total, so the two caps
still compose in either order. And like a day, a week the car is in for no time
is not a week it touched: an exit at exactly the start of a week adds no cap.

A flat special is one price for the whole stay, with nothing to split by the
week, so it is capped as it was: each week is allowed the weekly max, or the
daily max times the days the car is in that week where that is lower.
