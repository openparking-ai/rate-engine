"""The rule registry. Adding a rule type is how this module grows.

"In every state they have a different way to handle" -- so the list of ways to
calculate a fee GROWS, and the property that makes that safe is F7: registering
a new rule type changes no existing plan's answer, fee AND breakdown, byte for
byte. A registry whose members cannot see each other is what buys that; no rule
reads another rule's output, and none of them can reach the running total except
by returning a Line.

**The contract every rule type keeps, and the engine enforces on every quote:**

1. It returns LINES. Not a total, not a delta applied by side effect. A rule
   that changes the fee without saying so in words an operator can read is the
   failure this module exists to prevent, and it is unrepresentable here.
2. It is a pure function of (stay, plan, rule). No clock, no randomness, no
   ambient state -- F5.
3. Its money is integer minor units at every step -- F4.
4. It declares whether it qualified -- **and whether a non-qualifying rule SPEAKS
   depends on its stage.** A QUALIFY rule always returns a line: at delta zero,
   saying which condition failed. That is not politeness: "why didn't early bird
   apply?" is the question operators ask, and a breakdown that answers it only
   when the answer is good news is a breakdown nobody trusts. A rule at any other
   stage that does not cover the stay returns NOTHING -- the engine skips it --
   because a standard-space receipt listing every VIP tier the garage does not
   charge for is noise, not clarity.

   **This item used to say a non-qualifying rule ALWAYS returns a zero line, full
   stop, and that was false for every stage except QUALIFY.** `space_surcharge`
   documented the opposite in its own docstring, so the framework contract and a
   shipped rule type contradicted each other and nothing measured either. The
   distinction is real and worth keeping -- "this special could have applied to
   you and did not" is information; "a tier that was never about your space
   exists" is not -- but it is a rule about STAGES, not a blanket one.
   `tests/test_f22_the_silence_rule_is_per_stage.py` holds both halves.

   **AND THE STAGE IS NOT THE WHOLE ANSWER EITHER, which A2 had to find out.**
   The reasoning above is about the two KINDS of silence, and it used the stage as
   the proxy for them because in A1 the stage was a perfect proxy: the only rule
   type outside QUALIFY that could fail to apply failed by not covering the space.
   `time_window` broke that. A window with an `adjust` effect runs at ADJUST and
   can decline for a reason that has nothing to do with the space -- it is a
   Tuesday and the rule says weekends -- which is squarely the FIRST kind, the
   informative one, at a stage the old rule called silent. "Why didn't I get the
   weekend discount?" had no answer in the breakdown.

   So a type DECLARES it, with the `SPEAKS_UNQUALIFIED` trait, and the engine
   calls such a rule's applier even when it did not qualify -- **provided the rule
   COVERS the stay**, which is the half that was always right. A tier that was
   never about this space is still silent, whatever it declares.

5. It declares the STAGE OR STAGES it may run at, and a type that may run at
   more than one DERIVES each rule's stage from that rule's own shape. This
   exists because `time_window` is one condition with three effects and two of
   them are bases while the third modifies the total: a window with a `flat` or
   `rate` effect replaces the time-based charge and runs at QUALIFY, and one with
   an `adjust` effect is a percentage or an amount ON the whole fee and therefore
   runs at ADJUST, after the caps and the surcharges. Splitting that into two
   rule types would have split one operator decision -- "the weekend is
   different" -- across two documents, and the day-and-hours condition is
   identical in both.

   The plan still STATES each rule's stage, so the document is readable on its
   own, and `check_stated_stage` makes the statement and the derivation agree.
   Registering with a single stage is still the ordinary case and still works
   unchanged: `register("daily_max", CAP, ...)` takes a bare string.
