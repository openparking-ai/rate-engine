"""Taxes, surcharges and city fees: a percentage of the money actually paid.

**Tax applies to the money actually paid -- after every discount and validation.**
That is the owner's rule, and it is the only base there is. A tax rule states no
base, because there is nothing to choose: the caller hands in `subtotal_minor`,
the running total after every discount and validation line, and every rule in
the set is a percentage of that one number.

**Percentage only.** A flat tax amount is not expressible. That is a stated limit,
not a hidden one: no field for it exists, and a key this module does not
understand is REJECTED and named, never ignored -- so `fixed`, `minor` or `base`
on a tax rule is refused at load by the same mechanism that refuses an unknown
key anywhere in a plan.

**No compounding.** A tax is never taken of another tax. There is no way to write
one -- no rule names a base -- and there is no way to COMPUTE one either: the
applier is handed the subtotal and nothing else, and never sees the lines it has
already produced. See `tax_lines`.

**Every tax is its own line.** Several rules produce several lines, in the order
the garage states with each rule's `sequence` -- never the order the caller's
list happened to carry them, which decided money in this module once already.

**The set in force is chosen by the instant.** A garage's taxes change by law, so
it states them as SETS, each with an `effective_from`. A rate changing, a tax
added and a tax repealed are all one thing: a new set. The caller hands in every
set and the instant; this module picks, and does not ask the caller to filter --
the same argument the plan versions make. An instant before every set is
REFUSED, never taxed at zero. A set with no rules is how a garage STATES that it
charges no tax, and it is a statement rather than an absence.

**What this does not know.** No stay, no garage, no validation, no monthly
agreement, no card, and no storage. It is not a stage of the pricing pipeline:
`quote()` never sees a validation, and tax runs after one. It takes an amount, a
currency, an instant and the sets, and returns lines.
