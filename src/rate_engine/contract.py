"""The wire contract: version, request parsing, and ONE serializer.

Every surface -- `/v1/quote`, `/v1/validate-plan`, `/v1/validate-tax-sets`,
`/v1/tax` and their four CLI commands -- turns
its answer into JSON through the functions here and nowhere else. That is F6's
other half: proving the CLI and the HTTP route both MOVE when the engine changes
is weaker than proving they cannot differ, and a single serializer is what makes
the second statement true.

**Versioning, per §2.** A commercial contract is versioned on the assumption it
will GAIN fields, so consumers must tolerate fields appearing. The consequence
that keeps that safe runs the other way: this engine REJECTS a key it does not
understand and names it, rather than ignoring it. An ignored key is how a plan an
operator believes is live ends up pricing something else.
