"""The plan document: data, validated on load, never code.

Every field below is REQUIRED. There is no default anywhere in this file, and
that is the module's whole disposition rather than a style preference -- a
default is a pricing decision made by whoever wrote the engine, applied to a
garage whose owner never saw it. Where a plan is silent, the engine refuses and
says which field would have had to be invented.

**An unknown key is REJECTED and named, never ignored.** §2 versions a commercial
contract on the assumption it will GAIN fields, and that assumption is only safe
in one direction: a NEW engine must tolerate an OLD plan, but an OLD engine must
never silently accept a key it does not understand. An operator who adds
`weekend_rate` to a plan running on a version that has no weekend rule has a
garage pricing weekends wrong and a document saying it does not. So a key this
version does not know is a refusal that names the key.

**TIME. The plan states its timezone and every stay is an aware instant.**
This is not incidental. `time_window` speaks of "enter by 09:00"; `daily_max`
speaks of a day. Both are wall-clock ideas and neither means anything without a
zone -- and a day is 23 or 25 hours across a DST transition, so "24 hours" and
"a calendar day" are genuinely different rules rather than two spellings of one.
The plan names an IANA zone, entry and exit arrive as offset-aware ISO 8601, and
a naive timestamp is refused. `zoneinfo` is standard library, so this costs no
dependency.

#: made and the software ignored, which this module has shipped once before.

#: * `cheapest_wins` -- the LOWEST FEE FOR THE CUSTOMER wins. Compared on what
#:   the competing rules themselves charge for this stay, which is the only
#:   comparison available before the rest of the pipeline has run. Two rules at
#:   the SAME price cannot be separated by it and are REFUSED, naming both, the
#:   way two plan versions sharing an effective date already are.
#: * `stated_order` -- the plan names the rule ids, in order, and the first one
#:   that qualifies wins. It must name every rule at that stage exactly once: a
#:   rule left out would take a silent position, and array position deciding
#:   money is the disease `select_plan` exists to refuse.

#: A resolution mode answers "which of these is the price" -- an either/or, at a
#: stage where only one rule can win. Two adjustments are not an either/or: BOTH
#: apply, and the only open question is the sequence, because 20% off then 5.00
#: off is not 5.00 off then 20% off. An order is not a choice, so it does not
#: live in the field that records choices.
#:
#: Required-and-nullable, like `max_duration_minutes` and `week_starts_on`: a
#: field that may simply be absent is a field somebody forgets while believing
#: they set it. A plan with fewer than two adjustments writes null.
