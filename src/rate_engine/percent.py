"""A percentage of an amount of money: the ONE applier, shared.

Two things in this module take a percentage of money: a `time_window`'s `adjust`
effect, and a tax rule. They do not get one implementation each. A percentage
taken in two places is two answers to one question the day one of them is
edited, and the question is a customer's money -- so both call `percent_of_minor`
below, and the only thing that differs between them is WHICH rounding modes each
one lets a document state.

**Integer end to end.** A percentage is INTEGER BASIS POINTS -- 20% is `2000`,
12.5% is `1250` -- and the arithmetic is `amount * percent_bp` divided by 10,000.
The division is the only place a fraction of a minor unit can appear, so it is
the only place a rounding mode is read. No float is constructed at any point,
and `round()` is not used: Python's `round` is banker's rounding on a float, which
is two separate reasons it has no business deciding a cent.

**The applier refuses a mode it does not implement** rather than falling through
to one it does. The set a document may STATE is the caller's (`ADJUST_ROUNDINGS`
for an adjustment, `TAX_ROUNDINGS` for a tax), and each loader refuses anything
outside its own set by name. This function is the second line: it checks what it
IMPLEMENTS, never what a loader accepts -- the F15 disposition. It used to be an
`if down / else ceil`, which priced any mode that was not "down" as "up".
