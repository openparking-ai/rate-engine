"""The CLI. The same two operations, because an operator testing a rate should
not need an HTTP client.

**This is not a simulation mode.** `rate-engine quote` builds the same request
object `/v1/quote` builds and hands it to the same function, `contract.run_quote`,
and writes what `contract.encode` returns -- **the one encoder**, which both
surfaces call and neither re-implements. Exactly what is byte-identical is stated
once, in docs/CONTRACT.md's F6, F6b and F6c, which are generated from the tests
that measure it; a second hand-written copy of that claim is the one that drifts.

The one thing to know before piping it anywhere: the terminal newline is written
after the payload and OUTSIDE it, so stdout is the route's bytes plus exactly one
byte. `--json | cmp - <the route's body>` therefore exits 1 on EOF -- `cmp`
compares STREAMS, and one of them carries a newline the route does not send. Drop
that last byte and the two are identical, which is what
`test_the_cli_writes_exactly_the_bytes_the_route_returns` asserts over every
fixture. No byte count is written here on purpose: it would be a figure in prose
that nothing regenerates, which is the defect this paragraph replaced.

That is F6, and F6 is the control that matters most here: a test function that
answers differently from the production path is a tool that tells an operator
their garage will charge something it will not.

**It was false, by one byte, for the whole of A1.** `print(json.dumps(body,
indent=2))` appended a newline the route does not send -- 1152 against 1151 --
and there were three `json.dumps` call sites with two different argument lists
while the contract claimed "one code path and one serializer". F6 asserted
byte-equality and could not see any of it, because it decoded both sides with
`json.loads` before comparing: re-serializing with `indent=4, sort_keys=True`
left the test green. The guarantee is now measured on BYTES.
