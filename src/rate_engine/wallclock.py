"""Wall-clock limits and the granularity they are compared at. ONE place.

**The defect this closes.** `time_window` -- then called `early_bird` -- compared
`entry_local.time()` against an `enter_by` of `09:00` at full `datetime.time`
precision, so an entry at `09:00:00.001` failed -- and the breakdown, which
renders both sides with `%H:%M`, said *"entry 09:00 is after the 09:00 entry
limit"*. A sentence that contradicts itself on its face, deciding an $18
difference on a microsecond nobody can see.
§8's first requirement is that this module is EXTREMELY CLEAR; that line is the
worst available failure of it.

**The fix is granularity, not more digits.** "In by nine" means the minute 09:00,
to an operator and to a customer, and a limit written `HH:MM` cannot express
anything finer. So the STAY is truncated to the minute before it is compared, and
the rendered sentence becomes true rather than merely better-punctuated.

**AND THE LIMIT IS NOT TRUNCATED -- IT IS REFUSED.** The first version of this fix
truncated both sides. That is wrong, and it is wrong in this module's most
expensive direction: `time.fromisoformat` accepts `09:00:30`, a plan can state it
TODAY, and it decides the fee. Truncating the limit would silently discard a
pricing decision an operator wrote -- the engine overriding the plan, which is the
exact defect the early-bird day-span condition is being fixed for. A limit finer
than the minute is refused at load, naming the field, like every other thing this
module cannot honour.

**What is NOT a wall-clock comparison, and must never adopt this.**
`select_plan` compares `plan.effective_from <= stay.entry_at`: two absolute
INSTANTS, not times of day. Truncating there would change which plan version is in
force at a boundary -- a different rate card, not a rounder sentence. The date
comparisons in `time_window` and `daily_max.days_covered` are likewise unaffected:
truncating seconds cannot move a calendar date.
