# The rate engine contract

Version 6. One contract, five surfaces: `POST /v1/quote`, `POST
/v1/validate-plan`, `POST /v1/validate-tax-sets`, `POST /v1/tax`, and the
`rate-engine` CLI, which carries the same four operations. Our own platform is an ordinary
client of it — there is no private path and no in-process shortcut, so if this
interface is inadequate we find out before an integrator does.

**This module calculates. It takes no payment, holds no card, and stores
nothing.** A plan arrives on the call and is gone when the response is written.

`schema_version` **6**
<!--/gen:schema_version-->

## Versioning, and the unknown key

This contract is versioned on the assumption that it will **gain fields**. A
commercial module's contract moves because businesses change, so consumers must
tolerate new fields appearing in a response.

The rule runs the other way for requests, and it is what makes the assumption
safe: **a key this engine does not understand is REJECTED and named, never
ignored.** An operator who adds a key to a plan running on a version that has no
rule for it would otherwise have a garage pricing something wrong and a document
saying it does not.

### What changed in version 6

**A fill rule states two answers the owner gives, and a rule without them does
not load** -- that is a plan that loaded on version 5 and does not load here, so
the number moved. `raises_specials` says whether a charge a special priced is
raised too; `raises_vip_extra` says whether the extra for the stay's space class
is raised by the same percent. Both are required, each `yes` or `no` -- words,
because no bool appears anywhere in a plan (see "Money") -- and there is no
default: the engine does not decide for the owner what the rule
raises (F54). Plans with no fill rule load and price exactly as on version 5.

**A discount and a fill rule: the cheapest order.** Where both apply, every order
is priced and the cheapest charged, to the cent after rounding (F55); the line
`fill_level.order` says which. A plan whose `adjust_order` puts a fill rule
before another ADJUST rule does not load. Version 6 had not been released when
this was settled, so it is part of version 6, not a version 7.

**What a caller must do.** Add both answers to every fill rule, and list every
fill rule last in `adjust_order`. A consumer
reading breakdown lines meets three new line codes, `fill_level.special_not_raised`,
`fill_level.extra_raised` and `fill_level.order`; no finding code was added.

**Three corrections that move a fee, with no change to the plan document.** A
cap no longer counts a day or a week the car is in for no time: an exit at
exactly local midnight, at a 24-hour mark or at the start of a week adds no cap.
A week costs no more than the daily max times the days the car is in it, so
seven days and an hour at 30 a day and 100 a week is 130, not 200 (F56). These
two only lower a fee. A fixed discount takes off at most what the stay costs
when it is taken, and never less than nothing, so a stay cheaper than the
discount is priced at zero, not refused (F57). **That one can raise a fee.** A
fixed increase is still added in full, so a fixed discount larger than the
charge, listed in `adjust_order` before a fixed increase, no longer takes its
excess off that increase: at 3 an hour, 5 off then 4 added on a one-hour stay
was 3 - 5 + 4 = 2 and is 0 + 4 = 4, while the other way round it is 7 - 5 = 2 on
both. A caller whose plans list a fixed discount before a fixed increase should
re-price those stays. Which way a fee moves, as said here, assumes no
percentage discount over 100%, which the admin does not allow: with one, a fee
can move either way, and a total it takes below zero is still refused
(`CONFLICT_NEGATIVE_TOTAL`). The weekly cap's line and the discount's line say
more in their text, and no line code or finding code was added. On the HTTP
door, a negative Content-Length is a 400 and a connection that stops sending is
closed after a timeout (F58).

### What changed in version 5

**A plan may price on how full the garage was when the car came in.** A new rule
type, `fill_level`, raises the stay's time-based charge by a stated percent when
the garage was at least a stated percent full at entry (F51). A quote request may
carry the figure as `occupancy_at_entry_bp`, an optional key: basis points of
full, 0 to 10000, absent or `null` meaning the caller has none. See "The fill
rule" below.

**A VIP surcharge may be a percent.** `space_surcharge` keeps its flat
`surcharge_minor` and gains a second form, an `amount` of kind `percent` with its
`percent_bp`, and a `rounding`: a percent of the stay's time-based charge (F52).

**`validate-plan` has a fourth axis.** A plan with a fill rule is probed one basis
point below each threshold, on it, and at 100% full; the probe a finding names
then carries `occupancy_at_entry_bp` too (F53). A plan with no fill rule is probed
exactly as before.

**What a caller must do.** Nothing, to keep quoting: every plan that loaded on
version 4 loads on version 5 and every stay it priced is priced the same, whether
or not the request carries the new key. To use a fill rule, send the figure; a
stay in a class a fill rule covers that arrives without one is refused with
`GAP_NO_OCCUPANCY_AT_ENTRY`. A consumer routing on finding codes meets that code
and `CONFLICT_OVERLAPPING_FILL_RULES`.

### What changed in version 4

**A tie at the cheapest charge is priced, and its finding code is gone.** Two
rules that qualify at QUALIFY or ACCUMULATE and charge the same amount under
`cheapest_wins` were refused as `CONFLICT_MULTIPLE_RULES_AT_STAGE`. The rule the
garage owner gave is "always cheaper goes first", and at a tie nothing is
cheaper: the driver pays that amount whichever rule is named. So the stay is
priced at that amount, the lowest rule id is named as applied, and every other
rule says it charged the same (F48, which replaces F11). With the tie gone,
nothing could produce the code, and a registered code nothing can produce is a
promise with no mechanism behind it -- so it was REMOVED, and a removal moves the
number.

**A special that qualifies is never dearer than the time-based rate.** Under
`cheapest_wins` at QUALIFY, a special that qualified used to REPLACE the
time-based charge whatever it cost: a weekday car in at 08:00 and out at 10:30
paid a 9.00 early bird where the hour came to 7.00. The owner's rule is that the
driver always pays the cheapest way the stay can be priced, so the stay is now
priced through the whole pipeline twice -- with the special, and by the
time-based rate alone, caps, surcharges and adjustments included -- and charged
the lower; a tie keeps the special (F50). One engine line says which way was
used: `special_used` or `time_based_used`, its `rule_id` the special, delta zero,
and `compared_minor` what the other way would have charged -- absent when the
time-based rate alone cannot price the stay, in which case the special is the
only way. `stated_order` is unchanged (the special replaces), and so is grace,
which prices a stay alone. When the time-based rate is charged, every other
special keeps its line, as on the special's way: its own reason for not
applying, or a line saying it qualified and which cheaper special was compared
-- "was the cheaper special", never "applied instead", because none was.

**`validate-plan` reads the days and times of a window at every stage.** It used
to read them at QUALIFY only. The conflict a plan can still state is two
adjustments with no order, and an adjustment's window states its days and times
exactly as a special does; two discounts colliding only before 05:30 were never
probed there (F19).

**A `validate-plan` finding names the stay that found it.** Each carries
`probe`, the `entry_at` and `exit_at` of the first probe stay that produced it, so
an owner can be told which car it was about (F49). A refusal at quote time is
unchanged: it is about the stay the caller sent, and has no `probe` key.

**What a caller must do.** A plan that loaded on version 3 loads on version 4.
A stay version 3 refused for a tie is now priced. A stay a special priced under
`cheapest_wins` is priced at the same fee or LESS, and its breakdown gains the
line above; a consumer reading breakdown lines must tolerate that line and its
`compared_minor` key, which no other line carries. A consumer routing on finding
codes stops seeing `CONFLICT_MULTIPLE_RULES_AT_STAGE`; no code was added.

### What changed in version 3

**Tax, surcharges and city fees -- the arithmetic, and only the arithmetic.**
This module now computes tax lines: a garage's taxes are percentages of the
money actually paid, and `tax_lines` turns them into breakdown lines. See "Tax,
surcharges and city fees" below.

**Nothing a plan can state changed, and `quote()` answers exactly as it did.** A
plan that loaded on version 2 loads on version 3 and prices to the identical fee
and the identical breakdown. Tax is not a stage of the pipeline and is not asked
for by `/v1/quote`: the engine never sees a validation, and tax is taken after
one. The division a percentage adjustment makes moved into one function,
`percent.py`, which a tax rule shares -- and an adjustment still offers exactly
the two roundings it offered, `up` and `down`.

**What a caller must do.** Nothing, to keep quoting. To tax: hand `tax_lines` the
subtotal after every discount and validation line, and add the lines it returns
after them, so the fee is still the running total of the ledger. A consumer
routing on finding codes meets one new code, `GAP_NO_TAX_SET_IN_FORCE`, which
only the tax functions produce.

### A door added within version 3, and why the number did not move

`POST /v1/validate-tax-sets` and `rate-engine validate-tax-sets` hand a garage's
tax sets to `load_tax_sets` and answer what it answers (F46). **The number stays
3.** §2 moves it for a change a consumer must notice: version 2 for a removal,
version 3 for the tax arithmetic and a finding code nobody routing on codes had
seen. This round is neither. The loader's rules are the ones version 3 already
published; the door adds no rule, no finding code and no field to any existing
response; and a caller that never calls it gets byte-identical answers from every
other door -- including the `schema_version` stamp, which a bump would have
changed on every quote for no change in any price. A consumer that wants the door
asks `/v1/validate-tax-sets`, and an engine that predates it answers 404.

### A second door within version 3, and why the number still did not move

`POST /v1/tax` and `rate-engine tax` compute a garage's tax lines on a subtotal
(F47). **The number stays 3, by the same test.** The door adds no rule: it calls
`tax_lines`, whose arithmetic version 3 published. It adds no finding code:
`GAP_NO_TAX_SET_IN_FORCE` is the one it can return, and version 3 published that
too. And it adds no field to any existing response. A bump would change the
`schema_version` stamp on every quote with no price changing. A caller that never
asks `/v1/tax` gets byte-identical answers from every other door, and an engine
that predates it answers 404.

**The body of every POST is read as UTF-8, and nothing else is.** This is a
correction of a leak, not a removal, and it is recorded here because it changes
what a few bodies are answered. The contract never said a body could be anything
but JSON, and JSON over HTTP is UTF-8 (RFC 8259). But the body used to go to the
parser as bytes, and the parser guesses the encoding. A UTF-16 or UTF-32 body, a
UTF-8 body behind a byte-order mark, and surrogates encoded as bytes were all
decoded and answered. A malformed byte dropped the connection with no answer at
all. Now the body is decoded strictly first. A body that does not decode is a 400
saying it is not UTF-8. One that decodes and is not JSON gets the 400 it always
got, and an empty body still gets the request's own sentence. A caller whose
layer decodes the same bytes differently from this engine would otherwise be
judged on text it never sent.

### What changed in version 2

**A rule type was REMOVED, and that is why the number moved.** `early_bird` is
gone. It was a time window with its days hardcoded to every day and its effect
hardcoded to a flat price, and it is now expressible — with the days and the
effect stated — as a `time_window`. A plan written for version 1 does not load on
version 2: an unknown rule type is rejected rather than skipped, which is the
same rule that protects an unknown key.

No operator plans exist in the wild today, so removing a rule type costs nothing
now and could not be done quietly later. It is recorded here rather than left for
somebody to discover from a refusal.

**The other changes are additions.** `time_window` carries an `effect` that is a
flat price, a completely different time-based rate, or an adjustment up or down
on the whole fee — and the third of those brought the ADJUST stage live, so a
rule type now runs at a stage that depends on the rule rather than only on its
type. The stage is still stated in every plan, and the engine refuses a plan
whose stated stage disagrees with the one the rule's own shape implies.

Two rule types arrived with it: `grace`, and `weekly_max`. And two plan fields:
every plan now states `adjust_order`, null included, and `resolution` changed
shape.

**`resolution` is keyed by the RESOLVING stages only, and its values are
objects.** It used to require an entry for all five stages, as a bare mode
string, and to be acted on by nothing. It now decides which of several qualifying
rules applies — and the three stages it could never act on are refused as keys
this version does not understand, because a mode stated for CAP cannot choose
between two caps when both of them apply.

**Two classes of plan that used to be REFUSED now price, and that is a behaviour
change rather than a bug fix nobody notices.**

More than one rule qualifying at one stage was treated as a conflict at EVERY
stage. That is right where rules compete and wrong where they compose, and it was
harmless only while no second rule type existed at a composing stage.
`weekly_max` is that second type: without the fix, every plan carrying a daily
AND a weekly cap would have refused every stay in the garage.

And at a resolving stage, two rules at different prices are now settled by the
plan's mode instead of refused. The multi-rule conflict code therefore meant
something narrower than it did: a TIE. (Version 4 prices the tie too and removes
the code; see "What changed in version 4".)

**A window that would have to wrap past midnight is REFUSED, and that is a stated
gap.** `enter_from` later than `enter_by` — "enter between 22:00 and 02:00" — is
not expressible as one rule. It is refused at load, naming the field, and the
message says to write it as two rules: one running to 23:59 and one starting at
00:00, each stating its own days. The engine will not split it, because which
days each half applies on is a pricing decision.

## Money

Money is an **integer of minor units** — 800 means 8.00. A float, a bool or a
`Decimal` is refused at **any depth of a plan**, including in fields this version
does not read; and a string where money is expected is refused with them. A rate
that cannot be expressed in minor units is a rate this module refuses, and it
refuses it at load rather than at the point the arithmetic goes wrong. JSON
exponent form (`8e2`) parses to a float and is refused with the rest.

## Time

Every plan names an **IANA timezone**, and entry and exit arrive as offset-aware
ISO 8601. A naive timestamp is refused: it would be read in whatever zone the
server happens to run in, which is a different fee on a different machine.

This is not incidental. `time_window` speaks of "enter by 09:00" and `daily_max`
speaks of a day; both are wall-clock ideas, and a local day is 23 or 25 hours
across a daylight-saving transition. `daily_max` therefore requires the plan to
state whether a day means a local `calendar_day` or a `rolling_24h` window,
because those price a Friday-night-to-Saturday-morning stay differently and the
answer is the owner's to give.

## The pipeline

<!--gen:stages kind=1-->
**QUALIFY** → **ACCUMULATE** → **CAP** → **SURCHARGE** → **ADJUST**
<!--/gen:stages-->

The order is load-bearing: a cap that ran before the surcharge would cap a number
the customer is not being charged, and a surcharge applied after the cap is a
surcharge that survives it.

<!--gen:rule_types kind=2-->
| rule type | stage |
| --- | --- |
| `daily_max` | CAP |
| `fill_level` | ADJUST |
| `grace` | QUALIFY |
| `increment` | ACCUMULATE |
| `space_surcharge` | SURCHARGE |
| `time_window` | QUALIFY or ADJUST |
| `weekly_max` | CAP |

Every stage has at least one rule type in this version.
<!--/gen:rule_types-->

<!--gen:window_limits kind=2-->
| `day_span` | where the exit limit falls | an `exit_by` BEFORE `enter_from` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `same_day` | `exit_by` on the ENTRY date | **refused at load** |
| `next_day` | `exit_by` 1 local day after the entry date | carried -- this is the ordinary evening window |
| `any_span` | nowhere -- it names no last day, so the limit stays a bare clock reading | **refused at load** |

A wrapping `exit_by` is refused at load under `same_day` and `any_span`, neither of which can say what day the limit falls on, and carried under `next_day`. Stating a bounded span gives the limit a date; writing it as two rules is the other way to say it.

**The limit this does NOT close, stated because it is a limit.** Only the window that NO stay could ever satisfy is refused. One that can fire for some entries and never for others still loads, and `validate-plan` reports it clean: `same_day` with `enter_from` 06:00, `enter_by` 23:00 and `exit_by` 20:00 is dead for every entry after 20:00 and alive for every entry before it. Both halves of that sentence were priced to write it. The engine refuses what is unsatisfiable, not what is partly unsatisfiable, because the second is a shape an operator may well mean -- and a refusal there would reject a plan that works.
<!--/gen:window_limits-->

## The plan document

Data, validated on load, never code. Every field is required and **there is no
default anywhere**, because a default is a pricing decision made by whoever wrote
the engine and applied to a garage whose owner never saw it. Where a plan is
silent, the engine refuses and names the field.

A plan states a resolution mode for each stage that can RESOLVE — QUALIFY and
ACCUMULATE — from: <!--gen:resolution kind=1-->
`cheapest_wins`, `stated_order`
<!--/gen:resolution-->. A mode stated for any other stage is
refused by name: CAP, SURCHARGE and ADJUST compose, so a mode there could never
choose anything, and a field that cannot change an answer is a decision the owner
made and the software ignored.

- `{"mode": "cheapest_wins"}` — the **lowest fee for the customer** wins.
- `{"mode": "stated_order", "order": [...]}` — the plan names the rule ids and
  the first that qualifies wins. It must name every rule at that stage **exactly
  once**; a rule left out would take a silent position in the order.

**What `cheapest_wins` compares, stated because it is a limit.** Between two
competing rules at one stage, it compares what the rules themselves charge for
the stay — not the final fee. A cap or an adjustment downstream applies to
whichever rule wins and could in principle bring two different bases to the same
number. Between the special that won at QUALIFY and the time-based rate alone it
compares FINAL fees: the stay is priced through the whole pipeline both ways and
the lower is charged, a tie keeping the special (F50). Two rules charging the SAME amount are a
tie, and since version 4 a tie is PRICED at that amount: the driver pays the same
whichever rule is named, so the lowest rule id is named as applied and every other
says it charged the same (F48).

`adjust_order` is a different thing and is stated separately: a list of rule ids,
or null, giving the sequence the ADJUST rules run in. **An order is not a
choice**, which is why it does not live in `resolution`. It is
required-and-nullable like `max_duration_minutes` and `week_starts_on` — a field
that may simply be absent is one somebody forgets while believing they set it —
and when it is stated it must name every ADJUST rule exactly once, because a rule
left out would take a silent position in the sequence.

## Gaps, conflicts, and the refusal

A **gap** is a stay the plan cannot price. A **conflict** is something the plan
leaves for the engine to decide about money -- two adjustments with no order
stated, two plan versions in force at one instant. One mechanism serves both
places it is needed: `validate-plan` reports them so an owner can decide, and at
quote time a gap is a **refusal that names what is missing**.

**More than one rule qualifying at one stage means three different things, and
the stage decides which.** This used to be one answer for all five stages, and it
was wrong in a way that only a second rule type could expose:

- **QUALIFY and ACCUMULATE resolve.** Two rules are a genuine either/or -- only
  one of them can be the price -- and the plan's resolution mode settles it.
- **CAP and SURCHARGE compose, in any order.** Two caps are not a contradiction;
  they are two ceilings, and the lower one wins whichever ran first. Nothing is
  reported, because there is nothing for an owner to decide. Their lines are
  emitted in ascending rule id, never in the order the caller's array happened to
  carry them.
- **ADJUST composes, and the order changes the money.** Twenty per cent off then
  five dollars off is not five dollars off then twenty per cent off, so two
  qualifying adjustments with no stated `adjust_order` are REFUSED under their
  own code -- a different question from "which of these is the price", and a
  consumer routing on codes can tell them apart.

**A TERMINAL rule is not a conflict either.** It wins outright by what its type
is, rather than by anything the plan says, so a grace period beating a weekend
rate is settled and the beaten rule gets a line saying so.

**And at a resolving stage the plan's MODE settles it, every time.** Two windows
at different prices are priced by the cheaper under `cheapest_wins`, or by the
first named under `stated_order`. Two that charge the SAME amount under
`cheapest_wins` are priced at that amount too (version 4, F48): there is nothing
cheaper, the driver pays the same either way, and the lowest rule id is the one
the receipt names. Nothing at a resolving stage is refused any more.

**Every rule that lost is still on the receipt**, naming the winner, both prices
and the mode that chose — a breakdown that silently omitted a rate the customer
nearly got could not answer the question an attendant is actually asked.

`validate-plan` probes every boundary the plan DECLARES -- each entry limit, each
exit limit, each period length and stated ceiling, either side of each, across
every space class -- rather than a written list of scenarios or a search over all
stays. That is exhaustive over what a rule can express today and is not a claim
about every possible stay; the probe axes are derived from the rules, so a rule
type qualifying on something new brings its own axis.

**Deciding a finding does not resolve it.** `decisions[]` records that an owner
has seen a gap — `validate-plan` reports it as SETTLED rather than OUTSTANDING,
so a list can be worked through — and that is all it does. A decision carries a
code and a free-text note, and a note cannot price a stay; a stay hitting a
settled gap is refused exactly as one hitting an outstanding gap is. The way to
make a gap priceable is to add a **rule** that covers it, which is a visible plan
change. See F12 and F12b.

**The engine never returns a number it had to guess.** That is this project's
standing acceptance, and in this module it is also the entire commercial
argument: a system that refuses when it is unsure can be trusted by someone who
cannot check its work.

The lines above sum to 3000, which is the fee. That is not a coincidence and not a check performed afterwards: the fee IS the running total of the breakdown, and the engine asserts it on every quote.

## The guarantees

Each of these has a test proven able to fail, by planting the defect it guards
against and requiring red — `python scripts/fail_controls.py`. A test that has
never failed is a decoration.

<!--gen:guarantees kind=1-->
| id | what it proves |
| --- | --- |
| **F1** | The engine never guesses. A stay the plan cannot price is REFUSED, naming the gap, and no number is returned. |
| **F10** | Plan selection is never ambiguous. Two versions in force at the same instant are REFUSED and both named, never resolved by the order of the caller's list. |
| **F12** | `validate-plan` separates the findings an owner has still to look at from the ones they have recorded a decision for. Every finding is reported either way. |
| **F12b** | A decision is an ACKNOWLEDGEMENT, not a price. A stay hitting a SETTLED gap is refused exactly as one hitting an outstanding gap is; no entry in `decisions[]` can cause a fee to be produced. |
| **F13** | The fixture corpus holds a case either side of every threshold the rules branch on, read out of the plans rather than from a list -- so no guarantee is proven against a corpus that could only ever exercise one branch. |
| **F14** | A registered guarantee whose test stops running turns the build RED, including when its module fails to import; and a test module that plants a defect but registers no guarantee is refused. |
| **F15** | `increment.rounding` is CONSULTED by the applier, which refuses a mode it does not implement rather than pricing the stay under a different one. The applier checks what it implements, never what the loader accepts. |
| **F16** | Every refusal reaches the caller AS a refusal. A malformed number anywhere in a plan comes back as a named 400 naming the field, and a malformed rule return as a named 422 -- never as an exception escaping the quote contract, and never as a dropped connection. |
| **F17** | A rendered amount uses its own currency's ISO 4217 minor-unit exponent, never an assumed two decimal places -- and a code whose exponent this module does not know is REFUSED at load rather than rendered on a guess. |
| **F17b** | That refusal is at LOAD, so an unrenderable currency never reaches the renderer at all -- the membership check and the exponent read one table. |
| **F18** | A wall-clock limit is compared at the granularity it is written and rendered in: the stay is truncated to the minute, so no breakdown line can say a time is after itself. |
| **F18b** | And the LIMIT is refused rather than truncated. A plan may state 'HH:MM'; anything finer is rejected at load, because rounding it would silently discard a pricing decision the operator wrote. |
| **F19** | `validate-plan` probes every boundary the plan DECLARES -- entry limits and exit limits as well as durations, each side of each -- so a conflict the engine would refuse is one the owner was shown before the plan went live. |
| **F2** | A special rate is all-conditions-or-nothing: miss one condition by a minute and it does not apply at all -- no pro-rating and no partial credit. Enforced per rule type; `time_window` is the only special this module ships, so the property is proven of it rather than of a populated stage. |
| **F20** | There are TWO time roundings and both are declared: a part-minute is a whole minute (assumed, module-wide) and minutes into periods is stated per rule. Every comparison against a duration reads the same rounded value. |
| **F21** | A refusal's CODE names the cause that actually occurred. A negative total is CONFLICT_NEGATIVE_TOTAL, not the multi-rule conflict code it borrowed. |
| **F22** | Whether a non-qualifying rule appears in the breakdown depends on its STAGE: a QUALIFY rule always speaks, at delta zero; a rule at another stage that does not cover the stay is silent. |
| **F22b** | And the stage is not the whole answer. A rule TYPE may declare that it speaks when it did not qualify, so a weekend discount declining because it is a Tuesday says so on the receipt -- while a rule that was never about this space stays silent whatever it declared. |
| **F23** | The production invariant that the fee IS the ledger's sum is itself guarded: deleting it, no-opping it or unwiring it from the pricing path turns the suite red. |
| **F24** | A zero-length stay pays the first period -- a decision, published in the contract with the divergence it was disclosed with, not left for an integrator to discover as an anomaly. |
| **F25** | Whether a time window may run past midnight is stated by the PLAN, in `day_span`, with no default -- the engine holds no day condition of its own. `day_span` also says WHERE the exit limit falls: under a bounded span it is `exit_by` on the entry date plus the span, so a limit past midnight is a moment rather than a clock reading. `any_span` names no last day and keeps the clock reading. |
| **F26** | A window applies on the days the PLAN states -- weekday names, or the garage's own dates for a holiday or an event -- matched against the ENTRY's local date, and a window that did not match names the day that failed and the days it wanted. There is no built-in calendar and no preset: 'weekend' means different days in different countries. |
| **F27** | `enter_from` is CONSULTED, not merely validated and stored. A window states BOTH ends of its entry range, which is what makes an evening rate expressible, and a stay arriving one minute before it opens does not qualify. |
| **F28** | `day_span` `next_day` is BOUNDED: an exit on the following local day qualifies and one the day after that does not, where `any_span` accepts both. Proven on one stay, so the three spans are an axis rather than three unrelated scenarios. |
| **F29** | A `rate` effect is priced by `increment`'s own builder and applier, not by a copy of them: identical parameters produce identical lines on the same stay, and a change to `increment`'s period counting moves the window's lines with it. |
| **F3** | The plan version in force at ENTRY prices the whole stay. A rate change mid-stay never splits it. |
| **F30** | An `adjust` effect applies to the fee AFTER the caps and the surcharges. A percentage taken any earlier is a percentage of a number the customer is not being charged. |
| **F31** | An `adjust` percentage is integer basis points and its `rounding` is CONSULTED: the same stay under `up` and under `down` differs by one minor unit, and when the amount was rounded the breakdown line says which way it went; when the division was exact there is no rounding clause to state. |
| **F32** | `grace` is TERMINAL, and free means free: a stay at or under the stated minutes costs zero and picks up no surcharge, no cap and no adjustment. Terminality is DECLARED by the rule type at registration -- the engine never knows its name -- and a special it beat says so on the receipt. |
| **F33** | Two caps on one stay leave the LOWER ceiling standing, the total after CAP is the same in both application orders, and the breakdown names both. Caps COMPOSE; two of them are not a conflict. |
| **F34** | More than one rule qualifying at one stage means three different things, and the stage's category decides which: RESOLVING is settled by the plan's resolution mode (one rule applies, a tie included -- F48), COMPOSING order-independent is not reported at all, and COMPOSING order-dependent is refused unless the plan states the order. |
| **F35** | Two qualifying ADJUST rules with no stated `adjust_order` are REFUSED naming both; with an order they produce that order's total, and the two orders genuinely differ -- 20% off then a fixed amount is not the same fee as the fixed amount then 20% off. |
| **F36** | The resolution modes DECIDE. Two windows qualifying on one stay resolve to the cheaper under `cheapest_wins` and to the stated one under `stated_order`, on the SAME stay -- and the rules that lost still appear, each naming the winner, both prices and the mode that chose. |
| **F37** | A `stated_order` must name every rule at its stage EXACTLY ONCE, and one that does not is refused at LOAD, naming what is missing. A rule left out would take a silent position, and array position deciding money is what this module refuses everywhere else. |
| **F38** | Every identifier the published documents name in backticks is one the code actually holds -- rule types, stages, finding codes, plan and rule fields, stated values, traits and guarantee ids -- and every file path they point at exists. Derived from both documents rather than from a list of the sentences somebody remembered to check. |
| **F39** | A window's exit limit runs to the day its `day_span` allows. Under a bounded span the limit is `exit_by` on the entry date plus the span, so an evening window with an after-midnight limit applies to the car that leaves the SAME evening as well as the one that leaves after midnight. A limit that would have to WRAP to be reached is refused at load under `same_day` and `any_span`, neither of which can say what day it falls on. |
| **F4** | Money is an integer of minor units. A float, a bool or a Decimal anywhere in a plan is refused at load. |
| **F40** | A window's exit limit is compared as WALL-CLOCK readings, never as two instants, so a window behaves the same on the night the clocks change. On the hour that occurs twice at a fall-back, two stays leaving at the same stated time an hour apart in real time both qualify; a limit at a wall time that a spring-forward skips entirely still reads, and a stay past it is still refused. |
| **F41** | A tax rounds the way its rule states: `rounding` is required, with no default, and is one of `up`, `down` and `nearest`, where `nearest` takes EXACTLY half up, decided in integers on the exact remainder. Each mode is asserted on figures where it differs from the others, the exact half included, and when the amount was rounded the line shows the unrounded figure and which way it went; when the division was exact there is no rounding clause to state. |
| **F42** | Taxes never compound. Every rule in a set is a percentage of the same `subtotal_minor` -- the money actually paid -- and never of a total that already includes another tax line. A rule cannot state a base at all: the key is refused as the unknown key it is, and so is a flat amount. |
| **F43** | The tax set in force is chosen by the instant: the latest set taking effect at or before it, whatever order the sets arrive in. A new set is how a rate changes, a tax is added and a tax is repealed. An instant before every set is REFUSED, never taxed at zero, and two sets taking effect at the same instant are refused at load, both named. |
| **F44** | Taxes come out in the `sequence` each rule states, never in the order the list arrived in. A rule with no `sequence`, or two rules in one set sharing one, is refused at load. |
| **F45** | Tax on nothing is nothing. A subtotal of zero produces no tax lines, and the same rules on a positive subtotal produce them. A negative subtotal, or one that is not an integer of minor units, is refused. |
| **F46** | A tax set is judged by the loader and nowhere else. `/v1/validate-tax-sets` and `rate-engine validate-tax-sets` hand it to `load_tax_sets` and answer what it answers: every refusal it makes reaches both surfaces as the same named refusal, byte for byte, and what it loads is valid from both -- so a caller that stores only what this door accepted stores nothing the engine will refuse when it computes the tax. |
| **F47** | A tax figure is reached the same way from both surfaces. `/v1/tax` and `rate-engine tax` hand the request to one function, which calls `tax_lines` and writes its lines as a breakdown's are written, with their total: the same status and the same bytes from both, for a figure, a refusal and a request that cannot be read. |
| **F48** | A tie at the cheapest charge is PRICED, not refused. Two rules qualifying at one resolving stage and charging the same amount under `cheapest_wins` validate clean; the stay is priced at that amount, the lowest rule id is named as applied, and every other says it charged the same. A cheaper rule still wins whatever its id. Replaces F11, which refused the tie. |
| **F49** | Every `validate-plan` finding names the stay that found it: `probe`, the entry and exit of the first probe stay that produced it, and that stay produces it. A refusal at quote time carries no `probe` key. |
| **F4b** | That sentence is true at EVERY leaf of a plan, not at the fields the engine happens to read -- proven by probing every position in the document, so a field added in a later round is covered the day it exists. |
| **F5** | Determinism. The same plan version and the same stay produce the same fee AND the same breakdown, always, on any machine and at any wall-clock time. |
| **F50** | Under `cheapest_wins` a special that qualifies is never dearer than the time-based rate: the stay is priced through the whole pipeline both ways -- with the special, and by the time-based rate alone -- and charged the lower, a tie keeping the special. The breakdown says which way was used and what the other would have charged (`compared_minor`). Grace still prices a stay alone, `stated_order` still lets the special replace the time-based charge, and a stay the time-based rate alone cannot price is priced by the special. When the time-based rate is charged, every other special still has its line, as on the special's way: its own reason, or that it qualified and a cheaper special was compared instead -- never that one was applied. |
| **F51** | A fill rule prices on how full the garage was AT ENTRY. It applies at its threshold and above and not one basis point below; it raises the charge for the time -- the total after the base and the caps, less any discount taken before it -- and nothing else, and a plan ordering it before another ADJUST rule does not load; its line says how full the garage was and by how much the charge rose, and below the threshold says it was not raised. A stay in a class it covers with no figure is refused with GAP_NO_OCCUPANCY_AT_ENTRY; a plan without one prices the same with or without the figure. Two fill rules applying to one stay are CONFLICT_OVERLAPPING_FILL_RULES whatever `adjust_order` says. A threshold, a percent or a figure out of range, not a whole number, or a bool is refused by name. |
| **F52** | A VIP surcharge may be a percent of the stay's time-based charge -- the total after the base and the caps -- rounded the way the rule says, and never of another surcharge, so two surcharges total the same in any order. The flat form prices exactly as it did. A rule stating both forms, or a percent out of range, is refused by name. |
| **F53** | `validate-plan` probes the occupancy axis of every fill rule: one basis point below each threshold, on it, and at 100% full, across every other axis, so two fill rules colliding only when the garage is full are reported before a stay is refused for it, and the finding names the figure that found it. A plan with no fill rule is probed exactly as before, and a missing figure is not reported as a gap in the plan. |
| **F54** | A fill rule states the owner's two answers, `raises_specials` and `raises_vip_extra`, each "yes" or "no", and a rule that omits either or states anything else does not load, naming the field. `raises_specials` no leaves a charge a special priced unraised and says so; yes raises it. `raises_vip_extra` yes raises the space-class extra by the same percent on its own line; no leaves it as set. All four combinations, on each side of the threshold, price to the cent worked by hand, and flipping one answer moves the fee by exactly what that answer governs. |
| **F55** | Where a discount and a fill rule both apply, the driver pays the CHEAPEST order, to the cent after rounding: the discounts first and the fill rule on what is left; the fill rule first; the discounts first with each part (time charge, space-class extra) carrying its share; and the fill rule between discounts. The plan's stated order does not decide the price. A tie charges the first of those, and one line says which order was charged and what the others would have charged. Every pair of the owner's two answers, a percent and a flat discount, each side of the threshold, prices to the cent worked by hand. |
| **F56** | A cap counts only the days and weeks the car is in for more than zero time: an exit at exactly local midnight, at a 24-hour mark or at the start of a week adds no cap, and one minute past it does. A week costs no more than the daily max times the days the car is in it, so seven days and an hour at 30 a day and 100 a week is 100 + 30, not 100 twice. The two caps still compose in either order. |
| **F57** | A fixed discount takes off at most what the stay costs when it is taken, and never less than nothing. A stay cheaper than the discount is priced at zero and the line says the discount was limited to the charge, rather than refused as a negative fee; a discount smaller than the charge is taken in full. A fixed increase is added in full, so a fixed discount listed before it no longer reduces it: 5 off then 4 added on a stay of 3 is 4, and the other way round 2. A fixed discount never adds money: on a total a percentage over 100% took below zero it takes off nothing, so 150% off then 5 off on a stay of 3 is refused as a negative fee. |
| **F58** | The HTTP door reads a request body only within a bound. A negative Content-Length is a named 400 rather than a read to the end of the connection, and every connection carries a socket timeout, so a caller that stops part-way through a body is disconnected rather than holding a thread. |
| **F6** | The test function IS the production path. `/v1/quote` and the CLI emit the same response bytes for the same request, from one code path and one encoder; the CLI's terminal newline is written outside the payload. |
| **F6b** | And there is exactly ONE encoder. No surface re-implements the response bytes, so the two doors cannot drift the way they silently did. |
| **F6c** | The CLI's payload is the route's payload BYTE FOR BYTE, with any terminal newline written outside it -- compared as bytes, never as decoded objects. |
| **F7** | Registering a new rule type changes no existing plan's answer -- fee and breakdown byte-identical. |
| **F8** | The fee is the sum of the breakdown's deltas, by construction. There is no second route to the total. |
| **F8b** | A rule's only channel to the fee is a list of Lines. A malformed return is REFUSED by name, not left to crash inside the ledger. |
| **F9** | The published contract is DERIVED, never transcribed. Every generated block matches the code, and every block that ASSERTS something about its values is proven to move when those values contradict it. |

## What this version does not do

Named here so nobody adds them helpfully:

- **No counting.** The engine prices on the occupancy figure it is handed and
  counts no cars and no spaces; the caller says how full the garage was.
- **No plan storage, no draft/approve workflow, no change log.** Round B. A plan
  arrives on the call.
- **No forecast and no competitor comparison.** Round C.
- **No rate import from a photograph.** Round D, and it will only ever produce a
  draft.

## The fill rule

**"When the garage is at least X% full, the time-based charge is Y% more."** A
`fill_level` rule states `threshold_bp` (X, 0 to 10000), `percent_bp` (Y, 1 to
10000) and `rounding` (`up` or `down`, no default), with the space classes it
covers. It runs at ADJUST.

**It reads how full the garage was AT ENTRY, and nothing else.** The figure is
`occupancy_at_entry_bp` on the stay, set by the caller when the stay opened: every
car inside against every switched-on space. The engine counts nothing. A car that
came in when the garage was 70% full keeps that price however full the garage is
when it leaves. The rule applies AT the threshold and above.

**It raises the charge for the TIME**: the running total when SURCHARGE begins,
after whichever base priced the stay and after the caps, less any discount
taken before it.

**With a discount, the driver pays the cheapest order** (F55). Where a discount
and a fill rule both apply, the engine prices every order and charges the
cheapest, to the cent after rounding: the discounts first and the fill rule on
what is left, the discount set against the time charge first; the fill rule
first, the discounts on the raised total; the discounts first with each part
(time charge, space-class extra) carrying its share in proportion, the raised
part's share rounded up; and, with more than one discount, the fill rule between
them. The discounts keep the plan's order among themselves. A tie charges the
first of those. One line, `fill_level.order`, at zero, says which order was
charged and what the others would have charged: "Discounts and the fill rule
taken in the cheapest order: the fill rule first, then the discounts; another
order would charge 16.38 USD". 10.00 with 20% or 2.00 off at +20% is 9.60.
A plan whose `adjust_order` puts a fill rule anywhere but after every other
ADJUST rule still does not load, naming the rule: the price no longer depends on
it, and a plan that reads as "raise, then discount" would say something the
engine does not do.

**The owner's two answers** (version 6), both required, `yes` or `no`, no default:

- `raises_specials` -- `yes`: a charge a special priced is raised like any
  other. `no`: it is not, and the line says so: "Early bird special: fill rule
  not applied (garage was 84% full at entry, at or above 80%; this plan does not
  raise specials)". Under `cheapest_wins` the stay is still priced both ways, so
  the driver pays the cheaper of the unraised special and the raised time-based
  rate.
- `raises_vip_extra` -- `yes`: what the stay's space-class surcharge added, flat
  or percent, is raised by the same percent, on its own line: "Space class 'vip'
  extra +20% on 5.00 USD (garage was 84% full at entry) -- 1.00 USD added".
  `no`: the extra stays as set.

Each raised line is rounded the rule's own way, on its own.

**Its lines**, in the breakdown like every other: "Garage was 84% full at entry (at
or above 80%): time-based charge +20% on 30.00 USD -- 6.00 USD added", and below
the threshold, at zero, "Garage was 62% full at entry (below 80%): time-based
charge not raised". A class the rule does not cover gets no line.

**Never a guess.** A stay with no figure, in a class a fill rule covers, is
REFUSED with `GAP_NO_OCCUPANCY_AT_ENTRY` -- never priced as if the garage were
empty or full. A plan with no fill rule never reads the figure. Two fill rules
that both apply to one stay are `CONFLICT_OVERLAPPING_FILL_RULES`, whatever
`adjust_order` says: they are two answers to one question, and an order would
charge both. A fill rule naming a class the plan does not declare does not load.

**`validate-plan` does not probe "no figure".** That gap is a fact about the
caller -- a garage that has not stated its number of spaces -- not about the
plan, and reporting it would put a finding on every plan that carries a fill rule.

## A percent VIP surcharge

`space_surcharge` is a flat `surcharge_minor` per stay, or an `amount` of kind
`percent` whose `percent_bp` is 1 to 10000, with a `rounding` of `up` or `down`
and no default -- one form or the other, never both. The percent is taken of the same charge
for the time the fill rule reads, so two surcharges still compose in any order
with the same total. Its line: "Space class 'vip': 10% of the time-based charge
30.00 USD -- 3.00 USD on top of the base".

## Grace, and what "free" means

A plan may declare a grace period: `minutes`, a positive whole number, with **no
default and no grace unless the plan states the rule.** "Usually ten minutes" is
an observation about other people's garages, not a value to assume.

**A stay at or under that many minutes costs nothing, and nothing means nothing.**
Grace is TERMINAL: the pipeline stops after QUALIFY, so a graced stay in a VIP
space does not pick up the surcharge, does not reach a cap, and is not adjusted.
A receipt for a graced stay carries the grace line and nothing else. It also
beats any other special that qualified — and that special is not dropped
silently; it gets a line naming the rule that superseded it.

**All-or-nothing.** One minute over a ten-minute grace and the stay prices from
ENTRY on the ordinary rate, not from minute ten. That is the ordinary garage
convention and it is the same all-conditions rule every special here keeps.

**A grace of ten minutes covers 600.000 seconds and not 600.001.** Durations are
whole minutes rounded UP, module-wide, before any rule sees a stay — so a stay of
ten minutes and one millisecond is eleven minutes and misses a ten-minute grace.
That is coherent with every other duration comparison here, including the stated
ceiling on a time-based rule, and it is recorded rather than adjusted.

## A stay of zero length pays the first period

**Entry and exit at the same instant is priced, not free, and not refused.** The
first period covers `[0, first_period_minutes]`, so a car that enters and leaves
without stopping pays `first_period_minor` -- the same as a car that stayed one
minute or fifty-nine.

It is a DECISION, and it is published here because an integrator cannot otherwise
learn it: the number is correct under the rule as written, and it is the kind of
edge a garage owner will be asked about at the counter.

**It diverges from the platform's own older fee code, which returns zero for the
same stay.** That divergence is known and is a later round's to reconcile; it is
recorded rather than left for whoever notices the two answering differently.

A negative stay -- exit before entry -- is a different thing and is REFUSED as a
caller bug rather than priced at zero, because pricing it would hide it.

**And this paragraph now describes only a plan that declares NO grace.** A garage
that declares one makes a zero-length stay free by the grace rule, because zero
is at or under any positive number of minutes. Both behaviours are deliberate,
both are tested, and which one a garage gets is stated in its own plan rather
than assumed here.
- **No validations, no monthly parkers, no payments, no card.**
- **Tax only as arithmetic.** This bullet said "no tax" until version 3, and it
  is qualified rather than deleted: the module computes tax lines on an amount it
  is handed, and that is all. It stores no garage's taxes, applies none on its
  own, and `/v1/quote` does not add them -- see "Tax, surcharges and city fees".

## The first money rounding, and why money stays an integer

**A percentage adjustment is the first thing in this module that rounds MONEY,
and it arrives with the version bump §2 says a commercial contract makes.** Every
rule before it was an integer add or an integer replace, and `money.py` said in
as many words that this module rounds no money anywhere. That sentence is now
qualified rather than deleted: it rounds money in exactly one place, the place is
named, and the direction is the plan's to state. Since version 3 that one place,
`percent.py`, has two callers -- an adjustment and a tax -- and it is still one
function, so the two cannot drift into two answers.

**A percentage is INTEGER BASIS POINTS.** 20% is `2000`; 12.5% is `1250`. Not a
decimal, because a float anywhere in a plan is refused at load — so a percent
field that could hold `20.5` would either be rejected or would put a float into
the pricing path through a field nobody was watching. The arithmetic is
`total * percent_bp // 10000` with the division rounded the way the rule says,
and no float is constructed at any point.

**`rounding` is stated per rule with no default**, because a percentage of a fee
lands on a fraction of a minor unit and who keeps that fraction is the owner's
decision. When the amount was rounded, the breakdown line says which way it went
and by how much, so a customer disputing a cent can be shown the answer rather
than told it; when the division was exact there is no rounding clause to state.

**That rounding is not the rounding this module already had.**
`increment.rounding` rounds TIME into whole periods: it decides that a 61-minute
stay is two hours. **The applier reads that field and refuses a mode it does not
implement**, so adding a mode to the ones a plan may state is a real change
rather than a plan that quietly keeps pricing as `ceil` (F15). The two roundings
share a word and nothing else.

**One wart, recorded rather than hidden:** `rounding` is required on every
`adjust` effect, and a `fixed` amount has nothing to round — on that shape the
field is stated and never read. It is written down here rather than left for a
reader to notice.

Money stays an integer of minor units at every depth. Nothing here introduces a
float, and nothing here changes what a plan written against the previous version
answers, because such a plan no longer loads at all — see "What changed in
version 2".

## Tax, surcharges and city fees

**Tax applies to the money actually paid -- after every discount and
validation.** That is the one base there is. A tax rule states no base: the caller
hands in `subtotal_minor`, the running total after every discount and validation
line, and every rule is a percentage of that one number. A tax is **never taken
of another tax**: there is no way to write one, and the applier is never handed
anything but the subtotal (F42).

**Percentage only.** A flat tax amount is not expressible, and that is a stated
limit rather than a hidden one: there is no field for it, and a key this module
does not understand is refused by name -- a base and a flat amount included.

**Validating is a door, and so is computing.**
`POST /v1/validate-tax-sets` and `rate-engine validate-tax-sets` take a body
carrying one key, `tax_sets`, and hand its list to `load_tax_sets`, in
`validate-plan`'s shape: 200 with each
set's `effective_from` as read and its `rule_count`, or 400 with `invalid` and the
loader's own sentence naming the field. A caller that stores a garage's taxes
stores what this door accepted, and nothing else judges them (F46).

`POST /v1/tax` and `rate-engine tax` take the same `tax_sets` and the three
arguments `tax_lines` takes: `subtotal_minor`, `currency` and `at`. They answer
200 with `lines`, written exactly as a quote's breakdown lines are, and
`total_minor`, their sum. They answer 422 with the findings when no set is in
force at `at`, and 400 with `invalid` and the sentence of whichever check refused
-- the loader's, or `tax_lines`' own for a currency it does not render or a
subtotal that is not a whole, non-negative number of minor units (F47). The two
surfaces are one function, so a figure, a refusal and an unreadable request come
back as the same bytes from both. `/v1/quote` still does not call it: tax is taken
after a validation, and the engine never sees one. None of these doors knows
anything about a stay, a garage, a validation, a monthly agreement or a card.

A garage states its taxes as **sets**. A set carries `effective_from`, an
offset-aware instant, and `rules`; a rule carries `id`, `label`, `percent_bp`,
`rounding` and `sequence`, and every one of them is required.

- **`percent_bp` is integer basis points**, exactly as an adjustment's is: 8.5%
  is `850`. A float or a bool is refused at any depth, the same walk a plan gets.
- **`rounding` has no default**, and a tax's set is its own: `up`, `down` or
  `nearest`. Tax is conventionally taken to the nearest minor unit, which an
  adjustment cannot state; `nearest` takes EXACTLY half up, decided in integers
  on the exact remainder (F41). When the amount was rounded, the line shows the
  unrounded figure and which way it went, so a driver disputing a cent is shown
  the answer; when the division was exact there is no rounding clause to state.
- **`sequence` is the order the lines come out in**, a whole number unique within
  its set. The list order decides nothing (F44).

**The set in force is chosen by the instant** the caller hands in -- the latest
set taking effect at or before it. A rate changing, a tax added and a tax
repealed are all one thing: a new set. An instant before every set is refused
with `GAP_NO_TAX_SET_IN_FORCE`, **never taxed at zero**; two sets taking effect
at the same instant are refused at load, both named (F43). A set with no rules is
how a garage STATES it charges no tax. Which instant to hand in -- the exit, the
close or an invoice date -- is the caller's to state; this module only takes it.

**Tax on nothing is nothing.** A subtotal of zero produces no lines (F45). The
set in force is still selected first, so a gap in what the garage stated is not
hidden by an amount that happened to be zero.
