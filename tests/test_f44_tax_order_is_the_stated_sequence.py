"""F44 -- taxes come out in the `sequence` the garage states, never in list order.

Each rule carries a required `sequence`, a whole number unique within its set.
Array position decides nothing: a JSON list always HAS an order, so "the order
was not stated" is not something a list can express -- and the caller's array
position deciding money is the defect this module has already had to remove once.
