"""F22 -- whether a non-qualifying rule speaks depends on its STAGE.

The rule framework's contract said, flatly: *"A rule that did NOT qualify still
returns a line, with delta zero, saying why not."* `space_surcharge` documented
the opposite in its own docstring -- *"A stay in a space class this rule does not
cover produces NO line"* -- so the framework contract and a shipped rule type
contradicted each other and nothing measured either. The engine skips every
non-qualifying rule outside QUALIFY (`engine.py`, `if not QUALIFIERS[...]:
continue`), so the framework sentence was false for every stage except one.

The DISTINCTION is right and is kept. "This special could have applied to you and
did not" is the answer to the question operators actually ask at the counter; "a
VIP tier that was never about your space exists" is noise on a standard receipt.
What was wrong was stating it as a blanket property of every rule.

Both halves are pinned here, because a corrected sentence with no check is a
sentence that drifts back, and this one drifted for a whole round.
