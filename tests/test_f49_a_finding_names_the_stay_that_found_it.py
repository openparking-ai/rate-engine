"""F49 -- every `validate-plan` finding names the stay that found it (U7g).

An owner whose new rates are refused reads one sentence per finding. "Nothing
prices a stay of 1441 minutes" is true and is not enough: which car? The
validator found it by pricing a probe stay -- a car that came in at a moment
the plan's own boundaries make interesting -- and that stay is the answer. So
each finding carries `probe`, the entry and exit of the FIRST probe that
produced it, and the admin says the day and the time in the garage's words.

Set by the validator only. A refusal at quote time is about the stay the caller
sent, and its bytes are unchanged: no `probe` key at all.
