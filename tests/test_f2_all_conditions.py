"""F2 -- a special rate is all-conditions-or-nothing.

§8, from Gokhan: "Early bird will apply only if it meets that criteria." Miss one
condition and the rate does not apply AT ALL -- the stay prices on the time-based
rate. No stacking, no partial credit, no pro-rating, and not the cheaper of the
two. An early bird missed by an hour is a full time-based day.

The fixture is chosen so that the early-bird price and the time-based price are
DIFFERENT for the same stay. That is not incidental: if the two happened to
agree, every assertion below would pass whether or not the rule was applied, and
the control would be measuring nothing.
