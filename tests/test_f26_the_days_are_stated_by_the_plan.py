"""F26 -- a window applies on the days the PLAN states, and on no others.

Gokhan, 2026-09-07: *"if weekends selected display friday /saturday and ssunday/
monday display the entry and exit hours and apply to all weekends"*. Weekday,
weekend, evening, morning, holiday and event rates differ in WHICH DAYS and WHAT
HOURS, so the days are a field.

**The engine never stores the word "weekend".** It is Friday-to-Monday to the
operator who asked for this and Saturday-to-Sunday elsewhere; a preset would put
a pricing decision inside the engine. The dropdown expands to actual days.

**And the day is the ENTRY's.** §8's entry-time rule, and Gokhan's own event
case: a car that entered before the event pays the ordinary rate. A stay
entering Friday night and leaving Saturday is a FRIDAY stay.

Two kinds, one code path: `days_of_week` for anything recurring, `dates` for a
holiday or an event the garage types itself. There is no built-in calendar --
it would be right for one country and wrong for every other.
