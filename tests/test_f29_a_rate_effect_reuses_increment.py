"""F29 -- a `rate` effect is priced by `increment`, not by a copy of it.

Gokhan, 2026-09-07: *"it is not only %. or increase or discount. it could be a
complete different rate."* So a window's effect can be a whole time-based rate --
the weekend priced in twenty-minute periods where the weekday is hourly.

**The obvious way to build that is a second period calculation, and it is the
wrong way.** Two implementations of "how many periods is this stay" agree on the
day they are written and drift the first time one of them is edited, and when a
period calculation drifts the difference is money on somebody's receipt. There is
no test that catches drift between two copies, because both copies pass their own
tests.

So `increment` was refactored into two callable cores -- `build_params` and
`lines_for` -- and `time_window` calls them. This file proves the call is real,
in two ways that fail differently:

* the same parameters produce IDENTICAL lines through both routes, and
* changing `increment`'s period counting MOVES the window's fee. The second is
  the one a copy would survive: a copy would keep answering the old way while
  `increment` answered the new one, and the first check alone cannot see that
  because it compares the window against nothing but itself.
