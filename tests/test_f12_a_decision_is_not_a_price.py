"""F12 / F12b -- an owner's decision is an ACKNOWLEDGEMENT, and never a price.

`validate-plan` hands an owner a list of gaps and conflicts to work through, and
`decisions[]` is where they record having worked through one. Two separate
promises live on that, and they pull in opposite directions, which is why they
are two guarantees with two controls rather than one:

* **F12 -- the list separates.** An owner clearing a list needs to know what is
  left. A surface that reports the same undifferentiated list before and after a
  decision was recorded makes `decisions[]` write-only, which is what it was:
  `undecided()` existed, was correct, and was called by nothing.

* **F12b -- and separating changes NO answer.** A decision carries a `code` and a
  free-text `note`, and **a note cannot price a stay.** If recording one could
  make the engine start answering, the module would be inventing money from prose
  -- the exact failure it exists to prevent. So a stay hitting a SETTLED gap is
  refused exactly as one hitting an outstanding gap is. The way to make a gap
  price is to add a RULE: a visible plan change, which is how §8 says an owner
  resolves a gap.

F12 without F12b is the dangerous half. A split that an implementer later "made
consistent" by letting settled mean priced would satisfy every reading of F12
alone, so the control for F12b plants precisely that and requires red.
