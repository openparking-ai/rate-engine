"""F48 -- a tie at the cheapest charge is priced, not refused. Replaces F11.

**F11 refused it, and that was the last thing the resolution modes could not
settle.** W4 made `cheapest_wins` and `stated_order` decide between two specials
at different prices; what was left was two rules that both qualify and charge
the SAME amount, and F11 refused that stay naming both. The plan store calls the
validator before it keeps a plan, so a garage with a weekday early bird at 12.00
and a "come in before 10" rate at 12.00 could not save its rates at all.

His rule, 2026-10-11: **"always cheaper goes first"**. At a tie there is no
cheaper -- the driver pays 12.00 whichever rule is named -- so there is nothing
for an owner to decide and nothing the engine would be guessing. The stay is
priced at that amount. The receipt still names ONE rule, and it is the lowest
rule id: stated by the operator, stable, never the caller's array position. The
others say they charged the same, which is the true reason they were not named.

`stated_order` is unchanged: it names every rule at load, so it never had a tie.

The fixtures are F11's, kept on purpose: the same two windows and the same two
increments that used to be refused are the ones that must now price.
