"""F7 -- registering a new rule type changes no existing plan's answer.

This is what makes "customisable, and we will add new ways" a measured property
rather than a promise. §8: "adding a new way must not change what an existing
plan answers." Every plan already written keeps its fee AND its breakdown, byte
for byte, when the registry grows.

**The plugin registers at a stage a plan already uses.** A test-only rule type
parked at ADJUST -- the one stage nothing ships at -- would prove almost nothing:
no existing plan reaches that stage, so of course nothing moves. This one
registers at ACCUMULATE, beside `increment`, which is where a collision would
actually show: a pipeline that re-sorted its rules, a stage that iterated a
global registry instead of the plan's own rules, or a qualifier looked up by
position rather than by type would all break here.

**The corpus is derived, not listed.** Every plan file in tests/plans is priced
over every fixture stay. A plan added to that directory is covered by this test
the moment it exists, which a hand-written list could not manage.
