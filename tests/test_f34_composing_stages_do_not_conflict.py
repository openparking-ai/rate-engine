"""F34 -- "two rules qualified" means three different things, and the stage says which.

**The defect this closes was latent and load-bearing.** `find_conflicts` reported
a conflict whenever more than one rule qualified at ANY stage. That is right at
QUALIFY -- two specials are competing bases and only one can be the price -- and
it is wrong everywhere else. It stayed harmless only because A1 shipped one rule
type per stage, so no plan could reach the wrong branch. `weekly_max` reaches it,
and `time_window` at ADJUST reaches it twice over.

So stages.py carries three categories and this file holds all three arms. Testing
only the widening would leave "the engine no longer refuses anything" passing
every check.

* **RESOLVING** (QUALIFY, ACCUMULATE) -- an either/or. Still refused, still names
  both. `tests/test_f11_conflicts_are_refused.py` is the other half of this arm.
* **COMPOSING, order-independent** (CAP, SURCHARGE) -- both apply and the total
  is the same either way. Not reported at all: there is nothing to decide.
* **COMPOSING, order-dependent** (ADJUST) -- both apply and the order changes the
  money, so the plan states it. See F35.
