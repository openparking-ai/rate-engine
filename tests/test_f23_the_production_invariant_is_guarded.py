"""F23 -- the invariant in the production path has a test that dies with it.

**Measured in the outside-pass L3: deleting `engine._assert_ledger_is_the_fee`
outright left all 97 tests green.** The invariant sits in the production path on
purpose -- engine.py says so in as many words, "an invariant that only tests check
is an invariant that holds only where tests look" -- and nothing whatsoever
guarded it. It could have been deleted, no-op'd, or lost in a refactor, in
silence.

F8's own control on that property was
`assert ledger.total_minor != 501` against a hand-built `Ledger`: it never invokes
the invariant, so it passes with the invariant gone. The F8 GUARANTEE was still
covered -- `test_every_priced_fixture_equals_the_sum_of_its_lines` catches a
second route to the total on its own -- but the guard was checking a COPY of the
property rather than the property.

**This is the second time this project has shipped exactly that shape.** The first
was §6's own entry: a document-versus-renderer check where both sides carried the
same claim and agreed happily. Same lesson, second occurrence: derive the
expectation from the MEASUREMENT, never from a second statement of the assertion.

So these tests call the function. Delete it, no-op it, or make it stop raising,
and this file goes red.
