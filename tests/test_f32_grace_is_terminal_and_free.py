"""F32 -- grace is FREE, and free means free.

§8b, Gokhan's words: *"some garages uses grace period. usually 10 mins but
changes everywhere"* and *"if customer decides to laeve within that period it is
free."*

**"Free" is the whole guarantee, and it is not "grace returns a zero line".**
A rule that priced the stay at zero and then let a VIP surcharge, a daily cap and
a weekend adjustment run after it would return a zero line and charge the
customer five dollars. So the property measured here is the TOTAL, on a plan
carrying one of each -- and the control plants terminality off and requires red,
because a plan with no surcharge could not tell the two behaviours apart.

**Terminality is DECLARED by the rule type, not known by the engine.** An
`if rule.type == "grace"` in the pipeline would be the engine holding a pricing
decision no plan can see or change, which is the defect `day_span` was created to
undo. The type registers `TERMINAL`; the engine reads the declaration.

**And a special it beat is not dropped silently.** "Why is the early bird not on
here?" is the question §8 exists to make answerable, so the window that also
qualified gets a line saying it was superseded and by what.
