"""F60 -- a percent discount can never exceed 100%.

Gokhan, 2026-10-16: refuse it at save or validation time, not when a stay is
priced. A `time_window` discount with a `percent_bp` above 10000 used to load,
validate clean, and then refuse at the counter every stay it took below zero as
`CONFLICT_NEGATIVE_TOTAL` -- after the plan had been saved and the car had
parked. The Open Parking admin form already refuses one; the engine did not, so
any other caller could save it.

Now the plan does not LOAD. Every door answers 400, naming the field in the
sentence and carrying INVALID_PERCENT_DISCOUNT_OVER_100 as `code`, which is what
a plan store routes on. 100% itself loads and makes the stay free. Two things
this does not touch, and both are pinned: a percent INCREASE over 100% still
loads, and a FIXED discount larger than the charge loads and is limited to the
charge (F57).

`scripts/fail_controls.py` lets the discount load, refuses 100% as well, drops
the code, stops sending it, and bounds increases too, and requires this file to
go red each time.
