"""F17 -- the rendered amount matches the currency, not the number 100.

The defect, measured at 75c385b: a JPY plan returned `fee_minor` 800 -- correct,
800 yen -- and the breakdown said "8.00 JPY". The arithmetic was right and the
sentence a hundred times wrong, in the one artefact this module exists to make
trustworthy. `ZZZ` was accepted at the same time, by a check whose own diagnostic
claimed ISO 4217 and tested only shape.

Those were one defect and this is one guarantee: the module knows the currency,
or it refuses to price in it.

**The structural tests below are here because the table is TRANSCRIBED.** There
is no dependency to read the ISO register from, so `currency.py` is the only
typed table in this repo. These assert what can be asserted without a network --
that every exponent is a real ISO value, that the groups are disjoint, that no
code is malformed -- and the loader's refusal makes an OMISSION fail loudly
rather than render wrongly. What they cannot prove is completeness; the module
docstring says so, and the receipt names it.
