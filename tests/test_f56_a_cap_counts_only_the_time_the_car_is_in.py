"""F56 -- a cap counts only the days and weeks the car is in, and a week holds
only its own days.

Two defects, one plan. $8 the first hour, $4 an hour after, $30 a day, $100 a
week, New York:

* **A period the car is in for zero minutes added a cap.** `days_covered`
  counted the exit's own local date, so Monday 09:00 to Tuesday 00:00 was
  allowed two daily caps for no time at all on Tuesday: 60.00 instead of 30.00.
  A calendar week did the same at its start: Monday 00:00 to the next Monday
  00:00 was two weeks. A rolling window already counted this way -- exactly 24
  hours is one window -- and that is pinned here so it stays.
* **A week was capped at the weekly max times the weeks touched.** Seven days
  and an hour paid the weekly max twice, 200.00, although the hour's week
  holds one hour. A week now holds only its own days, and costs no more than
  the daily max for them.

**The figures moved again when the daily max became per calendar day (F59).**
This file was written while that was undecided, and pinned only what held
under either reading. Gokhan decided 2026-10-16 that each day is capped on its
own, so a minute past midnight is a second day holding the stay's sixteenth
hour -- 30.00 + 4.00, not a second 30.00 -- and the hour after seven days is a
second week holding 4.00. Those figures are re-pinned here; F59 holds the rule.

**And the boundaries are pinned on a flat special too.** A flat price is one
price for the whole stay, so a cap compares it with the max times the days and
weeks the car is in, exactly as before. That is the path where COUNTING the
days decides the money, so the boundaries are measured there as well as on the
lines a time-based stay prints.

`scripts/fail_controls.py` puts back the exit's own date, the week start at the
exit, a rolling day counted past the week's end, and the week capped by the
weekly max alone, and requires this file to go red each time.
