"""F20 -- both time roundings are declared, and every duration comparison reads one value.

money.py said *"The only rounding in the engine is TIME into periods, it is stated
per rule rather than assumed"*. There are TWO time roundings and the sentence was
false about the first of them:

* `Stay.duration_minutes` rounds a part-minute UP, module-wide, with no plan field
  reaching it -- ASSUMED, not stated per rule;
* `increment.rounding` turns minutes into periods -- genuinely stated per rule.

The outside pass found this was not merely a wording defect: a stay one
millisecond past a stated 24-hour ceiling is 1441 minutes against a 1440 limit and
is REFUSED rather than priced. The behaviour is kept -- it is the ordinary garage
convention, and §8 wants a stay nothing prices to reach the owner as a gap -- but
it is a pricing decision, so it is now stated where an operator reads it.

**What this file does NOT do is change the rounding.** It pins the behaviour and
pins the coherence: every comparison against a duration reads the same rounded
value, so the ceiling edge cannot drift away from the pricing edge.
