"""F4 -- money is an integer of minor units, and a plan that says otherwise is
refused at load.

Refused AT LOAD, not at the point the arithmetic goes wrong: a float that reaches
the pipeline has already been written into a plan an operator believes is live.

Three shapes are tested separately because they are three different ways in and a
guard that stops one lets the others past:

* a plain float (``8.5``)
* a float that looks whole (``800.0``, and JSON's ``8e2`` which parses to one)
* a ``bool``, which is an ``int`` subclass in Python -- ``isinstance(True, int)``
  is ``True``, so a naive integer check accepts it and prices the stay at one cent

And a fourth that is not about a field the engine reads: a float sitting in a
part of the plan this version ignores. It is refused too, because the round that
adds the rule type which reads it is the round it starts pricing something.

#
# "A float, a bool or a Decimal anywhere in a plan is refused at load" is
# published at four sites. Every individual test above was true and the sentence
# over them was not: a bool hit an early `return` in the plan-wide walk and a
# Decimal fell off the end of it, so both were ACCEPTED at all four `decisions[]`
# fields -- the only leaves in a plan that nothing else types.
#
# The fix was to make the sentence true rather than to narrow it. What holds it
# true is the derived test below, not the two examples: an example passes for one
# field, and the sentence is a claim about every field there is or will be.
