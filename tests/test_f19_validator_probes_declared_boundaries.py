"""F19 -- the validator probes the boundaries the plan declares, entry included.

The defect, settled by execution in the outside-pass L3: every probe entered at
07:00 and varied only the duration. Two `early_bird` rules -- the rule type now
called `time_window` -- that both qualify only
for an entry before 06:00 therefore never overlapped in any probe --
`validate-plan` printed "no gaps, no conflicts" and exited 0, and a real stay
entering at 05:00 was then REFUSED for a conflict. The published sentence said it
"reports every such gap, and every conflict between rules, before a plan goes
live", and the validator is the product.

The fix is not exhaustiveness and not a weaker sentence. A rule that names a time
makes that time interesting, and the plan is where those times live -- so ENTRY
became a derived axis alongside duration, and the sentence now says what the
mechanism does.

**The counterexample below is the L3's own, unchanged.** A fix verified against a
new test written to pass would prove nothing; §6 requires the exact probe that
failed.

#: Two rules that both qualify only for an entry before 06:00, on a plan with no
#: ceiling so no unrelated gap masks the result. The L3's counterexample, carried
#: forward onto `time_window` unchanged in everything it measures: the two rules
#: apply on every day, so the day axis cannot be what makes them overlap.
#:
#: **They now charge the SAME price, and that is not cosmetic.** W4 made the
#: resolution modes act, so two rules at different prices are no longer a
#: conflict -- `cheapest_wins` settles them. What survives is the tie, which
#: nothing can settle, and this file is about whether the VALIDATOR sees what the
#: engine would refuse. A fixture the engine no longer refuses would have made it
#: pass while measuring nothing.
