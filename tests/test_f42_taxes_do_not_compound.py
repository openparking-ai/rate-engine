"""F42 -- taxes never compound. Every rule is a percentage of the same subtotal.

"Tax of the tax is extremely unusual" -- the owner's words. The guarantee has two
halves, and they are held in two different places:

* **The arithmetic.** Every rule in a set is computed from `subtotal_minor`, the
  money actually paid, and never from a total that already includes another tax
  line. There is no way left to WRITE a compounding rule, so this is where the
  guarantee actually lives, and it is held by a figure that differs if the bug
  is present.
* **The grammar.** A rule cannot state a base at all. `base` is refused by the
  same unknown-key rejection every field in this module gets -- no bespoke
  refusal, because a bespoke refusal for a key nobody may write is a field
  somebody eventually reads.
