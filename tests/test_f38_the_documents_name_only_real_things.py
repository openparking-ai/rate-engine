"""F38 -- every identifier the published documents name in backticks exists.

**This is the defect the estate paid for three times in one day: a true-sounding
published sentence sitting over correct code.** A document that names
`early_bird` after `early_bird` is deleted reads perfectly. Nothing compiles it,
nothing imports it, and the reader it misleads is an integrator or an operator
rather than a test runner. `docs/CONTRACT.md`'s generated blocks are derived and
cannot rot -- but the prose AROUND them is ordinary writing, and so is all of
README.md, and prose is where the rot lives.

So the sites are DERIVED rather than listed. Every backticked token in the two
published documents is pulled out and classified against what the code actually
holds -- the rule registry, the stage names, the finding codes, the plan's own
keys, every field each rule type accepts, every enumerated value a plan may
state, the traits, and the guarantee ids. A token that looks like something this
module owns and is not one of them fails this test, naming it.

**Anything else must be in VOCABULARY, below.** That list is not a loophole, it
is the record: it holds the backticked words that are English, JSON or Python
rather than identifiers of ours, and adding to it is a deliberate act somebody
writes down. A check whose escape hatch is silent is not a check.

What this does NOT claim: that every SENTENCE is true. No mechanism can decide
that. It claims that every NAME is real, which is the half that can be decided
and the half that has actually gone wrong here.

#: this module does not own, and including it would mean allowlisting four words
#: that are genuinely not ours -- which weakens the allowlist for no gain.
#:
#: Note that README.md uses bold far more than backticks, so what is checked
#: there is a handful of tokens. That is a limit of the mechanism and is stated
#: rather than papered over: this proves every NAME the documents mark as code is
#: real, not that every claim in them is true.
