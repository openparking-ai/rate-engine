"""F40 -- the exit limit is a WALL-CLOCK reading, so a window survives the night
the clocks change.

**The state this closes was not a wrong answer. It was an unguarded right one.**
The L review of the round that added F39 measured the behaviour correct and the
guarantee absent: it built the counter-model this module's fail control now uses
-- a TRUE instant comparison, through `.timestamp()` -- watched it misprice the
repeated hour 40.00 -> 24.00, and then watched **all 338 tests stay green with it
installed**, over 17,565 bounded exit comparisons of which not one was decided
differently. The suite contained no stay on which the two readings disagree, so
nothing in it could tell a wall-clock limit from an instant one.

Both of the modules that could have held this deliberately look away: F39 says
"October 2026 dates sit away from the US daylight-saving transition", F28 says
the same of March. Correctly -- neither is about DST -- but the effect was that a
US garage met this every November and the suite did not.

**Why the repeated hour is the whole fixture.** On 2026-11-01 in
America/New_York, 01:00-01:59 happens TWICE: once at UTC-4 and again, an hour
later in real time, at UTC-5. A window whose `exit_by` falls inside that hour is
therefore the one case where "the same clock reading" and "the same instant" are
different questions, and the plan states a clock reading. Two stays leaving at
01:00 -- one on each pass, one hour apart in elapsed time -- must BOTH get the
rate, because the plan says out by 01:30 and both left at one.

The spring boundary is the mirror: on 2026-03-08 the wall time 02:00 never
occurs at all, so a window with `exit_by 02:00` states a limit that has no
instant. It still has a READING, and the stay that left at 01:59 is inside it
while the one that left at 03:00 -- one real minute later -- is not.

**The fail control is the counter-model, not a mutation of a number.** A DST test
that stays green when the comparison is switched to instants is measuring
nothing, and that is precisely the state the suite was in before this module. See
`scripts/fail_controls.py`, control F40.
