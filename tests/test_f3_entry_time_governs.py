"""F3 -- the plan in force at ENTRY prices the whole stay.

§8, his words: "the price is calculated always with the entry time fee." A rate
change mid-stay never splits the stay. A car that entered on Friday under the old
card leaves on Sunday paying Friday's prices, and a garage that put its rates up
on Saturday morning does not reach back into it.

**This test is why `/v1/quote` takes a LIST of plan versions.** Handed exactly one
plan, an engine cannot demonstrate that it selected by entry rather than by exit
-- there is nothing to select, and the guarantee would be a sentence with no
mechanism behind it. Nothing is stored: the versions arrive on the call, and the
plan STORE is round B.
