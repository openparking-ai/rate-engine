"""F36 -- the resolution modes decide which rule is NAMED, and never the money.

**They were a decision the owner made and the software ignored.** `resolution`
was required on every plan, validated against two named modes, published in the
contract's own table -- and read in exactly one place: the text of a conflict
finding, quoting the mode back while declining to apply it. `find_conflicts` said
so in its own docstring. A required field that changes no answer is the shape of
defect this project has a name for, and it shipped here for a whole round.

Two modes, and the same stay under both, because that is the only arrangement
that shows the FIELD deciding rather than one plan pricing one way:

* `cheapest_wins` -- the lowest fee for the customer. Gokhan's, confirmed in
  session.
* `stated_order` -- the plan names the rule ids and the first that qualifies
  wins.

**And then the owner made the cheapest win everywhere** (Gokhan, 2026-10-16,
F63): when more than one price could apply to the same time, the car pays the
cheapest. `stated_order` charged the dearer of two windows when the plan named
it first; it no longer can. Both modes charge the cheaper window. What the mode
still decides is the NAME where two windows charge the same: the lowest rule id
under `cheapest_wins`, the first in the order under `stated_order` -- on the
same stay, and reversing the order reverses it. So the field still changes an
answer the owner can read, and this file still shows it doing so.

**And the rules that LOST still appear on the receipt.** §8's first requirement
is that a customer can read why they were charged what they were charged, and a
breakdown that silently omits a rate the customer nearly got cannot answer the
question an attendant is actually asked. The line names the loser, its price, the
winner, the winner's price, and the mode that chose between them.

The fixture prices the two windows differently, so the cheaper can be seen
winning under both modes, and the SAME (`TIE`), so the mode can be seen naming.
