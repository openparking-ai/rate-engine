"""F22c -- a special for another space class charges nothing.

A QUALIFY rule speaks whether it qualified or not: the engine asks every special
for its lines, so a receipt can say why the early bird was not given. The
qualifier asks the stay's space class; the appliers did not. So a special
scoped to one class, met on every time by a stay of another class, answered
"applied", with its price, and the engine added that price beside the
time-based rate the stay was also charged:

* $8 the first hour and $4 an hour after, with a 30.00 flat for VIP spaces: a
  two-hour standard stay was 42.00 instead of 12.00. Since the caps check what
  the base charged against the receipt (F59), the same stay stops the quote
  instead, and the HTTP door drops the connection with no answer.
* The reference plan's early bird is for standard spaces. A VIP stay in its
  window, Tuesday 07:30 to 16:30, carried "Early bird ... applied +12.00".
* A grace for VIP spaces told a five-minute standard stay "there is no charge,
  and nothing further is added", on a receipt that then charged it 8.00.

Such a special now gets its not-applied line, at zero, saying the stay's class
is not one it covers -- what `apply` says it returns for a rule that did not
qualify. The class is said only when it is the only reason. A special for
another class that failed on its times keeps the line it has always had, so no
receipt that priced correctly changes. Whether a special for another class
should be on the receipt at all is an open question, not settled here.

The sweep at the end holds the whole property: on every stay, a plan's quote is
the quote of the same plan with its specials for other classes taken out, but
for those specials' own lines, each at zero. Every special in the earlier
sweeps covered both classes, which is how this went unseen.

`scripts/fail_controls.py` takes the class check out of each applier, and has
the class said where a time had already failed, and requires red.
