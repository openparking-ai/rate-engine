"""F16, at the body -- a POST body is decoded strictly as UTF-8, and anything else
is a named 400 rather than a dropped connection or a guess.

`do_POST` handed the raw BYTES to `json.loads`, which runs its own encoding
detection. Measured at 0ca131f, on every POST route: a malformed byte raised a
`UnicodeDecodeError` that nothing caught, and the client got `RemoteDisconnected`
-- no status, no body. And a UTF-16 or UTF-32 body, a UTF-8 body behind a
byte-order mark, and surrogates encoded as bytes were all DECODED and answered
200 on `/v1/validate-tax-sets`. A caller whose own layer decodes those bytes
differently from this engine -- Express replaces a bad byte with U+FFFD -- is then
judged on text it never sent. JSON over HTTP is UTF-8 (RFC 8259); the body is
decoded as that and nothing else, and only then parsed.

**Two instruments, and they are not mixed.**

  - `PROVES_THE_DECODE`: bodies refused with the ENCODING sentence. Each one
    dropped the connection or answered without the fix, so each is a
    measurement of it.
  - `STAYS_REFUSED`: a UTF-16BE body with no byte-order mark and a UTF-8 body
    with one. Both ARE valid UTF-8 -- ASCII plus NUL bytes; a byte-order mark is
    a character -- so they decode and are refused by the JSON parser, with the
    sentence an invalid-JSON body gets. They are here so they stay refused, not
    as evidence of the decode: the JSON sentence cannot tell the fix from its
    absence. (Both answered 200 before the fix, measured; naming them by an
    encoding-specific sentence would need a new rule, and none was asked for.)

`scripts/fail_controls.py` puts the auto-detecting decode back, and separately
removes the catch, and requires this file to go red each time.
