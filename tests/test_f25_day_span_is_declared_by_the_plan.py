"""F25 -- whether a time window may run past midnight is the PLAN's decision.

The defect the outside pass settled as TRUE -- DEFECT: `_failures` compared the
exit's local date to the entry's and refused any cross-midnight stay. The rule's
own docstring said the conditions were *"entry at or before `enter_by`, exit at or
before `exit_by`"* and nothing else; `EXTRA` held three fields, none of them about
days; and the condition appeared in exactly one place in the whole repository --
the message it printed when it fired.

A stay entering Monday 08:00 and leaving Tuesday 08:00 satisfies both stated
limits and was charged **6000** where the early bird was **1200**. The plan could
not state the condition and could not remove it: every attempt was rejected as an
unknown key. That is the engine inventing a pricing decision, which is the one
thing this module exists not to do.

Gokhan, asked directly: *"I've never seen multiple day early bird but this is
parking. People get creative."* So `day_span` is a declared field with no default.

**The rule this guarantee was written for is now `time_window`** -- `early_bird`
was that rule with its days hardcoded to every day and its effect hardcoded to a
flat price -- and the guarantee moved with it unchanged. The BOUNDED middle case,
`next_day`, has its own guarantee: F28.
