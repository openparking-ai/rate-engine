"""F15 -- `increment.rounding` is CONSULTED, and a mode this version does not
implement is refused rather than priced as something else.

The field was validated at load, stored on the rule, and read by nothing.
`apply()` hardcoded ceil, so setting `rounding` to `floor`, `nearest`, `banana`
or `null` produced a byte-identical fee. Nothing noticed, because the loader only
ever let `ceil` through and `ceil` is what the hardcoded arithmetic did.

**The defect is a forward one, and that is what makes it worth a guarantee.** A2
adds `floor` to the modes a plan may state. The moment it does, a plan saying
`floor` prices as `ceil` — silently, with a document that reads correctly to the
operator who wrote it and a fee that is simply wrong. There is nothing an
operator can inspect to catch that: their plan says what they meant.

So the applier asks what IT implements, never what the loader accepts. Those are
two different questions and the whole guarantee lives in the difference:
`test_the_applier_checks_what_it_IMPLEMENTS_not_what_the_loader_ACCEPTS` below is
A2's exact scenario, run today.
