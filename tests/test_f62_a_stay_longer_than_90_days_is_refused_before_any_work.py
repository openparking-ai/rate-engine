"""F62 -- the longest stay priced is 90 days, and a longer one is refused before
any work is done.

Gokhan, 2026-10-16: the longest stay the rate engine prices is 90 days. A longer
stay is refused with a clear code, documented in the contract, so the platform or
the lane can show "needs an operator"; and the limit is visible during rate setup.

**It is also the bound a review asked for.** Capping each day on its own (F59)
walks the stay a day at a time, so a quote's time grew with the days in the stay
-- a stay running to the year 9999 took about fifteen seconds of CPU -- and
nothing bounded how long a stay a caller could send. The limit is checked FIRST:
before the plan is selected, before a day is walked, before a base is asked what
it charged. So the longest stay the request format can carry, year 1 to year
9999, is refused with no more work than ninety days and one second.

What this file pins:

* 90 days to the second is priced; one second more, and one minute more, is not.
* Elapsed time, not dates: across a clock change the limit is still 90 x 24 hours.
* The refusal is a 422 at every door -- the pricing path, HTTP, the CLI -- coded
  `GAP_STAY_LONGER_THAN_MAX_STAY`, naming the limit and the stay's length, alone.
* It comes first: a too-long stay that no plan is in force for, or that its plan
  would refuse for another reason, is refused for its length.
* No work: counted -- no base asked, no day start found, no plan selected -- and
  timed, best of five.
* One constant: `validate-plan` answers `max_stay_minutes`, and changing
  `MAX_STAY_DAYS` moves the limit and the answer together.

`scripts/fail_controls.py` removes the limit, moves it to refuse 90 days itself,
checks it only after the stay is priced, copies the number instead of reading the
constant, drops it from the `validate-plan` answer, and names the wrong code, and
requires this file to go red each time.
