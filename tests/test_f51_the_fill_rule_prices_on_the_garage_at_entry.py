"""F51 -- the fill rule prices on how full the garage was when the car came in.

"When the garage is at least X% full, the time-based charge is Y% more." The
figure is `occupancy_at_entry_bp`, handed in by the caller when the stay opened,
and it is read at entry and only at entry: the cars inside keep the price they
came in on.

**The fixture straddles every edge on purpose.** 80% full is 8000 basis points,
so the stays sit at 7999 (not raised), 8000 (raised: the rule applies AT the
threshold) and 10000. The charge is chosen so the plants each move a different
number: 3 hours at 8.00 + 2 x 4.00 = 16.00 by the hour, +20% = 3.20; a 10.00 daily
most makes a long stay's time charge 10.00, so a rule raising the UNcapped 44.00
is caught; and a 5.00 VIP surcharge on top makes a rule raising the running total
(21.00) rather than the time (16.00) charge 4.20 instead of 3.20.
