"""F63 -- the cheapest price always wins.

Gokhan, 2026-10-16: **when more than one price could apply to the same time, the
car pays the cheapest.** And 2026-10-17, on a flat special that spans several
days: **compare whole-stay alternatives.** A special spanning several days is one
price for the stay it covers. It is compared with the normal price for the whole
stay -- each calendar day capped by the daily max, each week by the weekly max --
and the cheaper is charged. His example, a $50 Friday-to-Sunday flat with a $30
daily max and an hourly rate that reaches $30 within a day: **Saturday only pays
$30; all weekend (Friday to Sunday) pays $50.**

Every place the engine chooses between prices for the same time was audited, and
this file pins each:

* **A flat special against a daily or weekly max.** One price for the stay it
  covers, never split by the day. The caps hold it to the max for each day and
  each week the car is in -- 30.00 on a Saturday alone, 90.00 over Friday to
  Sunday -- and the engine charges the cheaper of it and the time-based rate's
  whole stay. On one day that is the day's max, as it was. A first reading of
  the 10-16 rule owed the whole price on the day of entry and capped it there,
  which made the full weekend 30.00: the whole special capped at one day. The
  10-17 decision corrects that, and a control puts it back.
* **Two specials, or two time-based rates, for one stay.** They were compared on
  what the RULES charged, and only the special that won was compared with the
  time-based rate on the fee. A cap can make the rule that charges more the
  cheaper stay. Every way is now priced through the whole pipeline and the
  lowest FEE charged; the losing rule's line says what the stay comes to by
  each, where the rules' own prices do not say why it lost.
* **`stated_order`.** The plan's order chose outright, so a dearer special
  replaced a cheaper one, and the time-based rate, whatever the driver paid.
  The cheapest is charged under either mode; the order names one of two ways
  that charge the same (F36).

The stay a special covers is the stay it qualified for. A window is all of its
conditions or nothing (section 8), so a stay that runs past a special's exit
limit is not covered by it and the time-based rate prices the whole stay, as
before. And the longest stay priced is still 90 days (F62): the limit comes
before any special is asked.

And what is NOT a choice stays as it was: a surcharge and a fixed increase are
added; the caps already leave the lowest ceiling standing; the discounts apply
in the plan's stated order. Both halves are pinned below, and a sweep checks the
rule itself: the fee is the least of the fees each way charges on its own.

`scripts/fail_controls.py` puts back the whole special owed and capped on the
day of entry, a flat price no cap holds, a special charged over a cheaper hour,
a special that covers a stay past its limit, the 90-day limit taken out, the
rules' own charges deciding, the stated order deciding, the losing line without
the whole stay, and a tie named by id alone, and requires this file to go red
each time.
