"""F18 -- a wall-clock limit decides on the minute it renders, and nothing finer.

The defect, measured at 75c385b on the shipped plan with no edit: an entry at
`09:00:00.000001` failed an `enter_by` of `09:00`, and the breakdown said

    Early bird NOT applied: entry 09:00 is after the 09:00 entry limit.

fee_minor 1200 -> 3000. Eighteen dollars, decided by a microsecond, explained by a
sentence that is false on its face. §8's first requirement is that this module is
EXTREMELY CLEAR, and a self-contradicting line is the worst failure of it.

Two halves, and the second is why the first is safe:

* the STAY is truncated to the minute before comparison, so the rendered sentence
  is true;
* a LIMIT finer than a minute is REFUSED at load, not truncated. `time.fromisoformat`
  accepts `09:00:30` and a plan can state it today, where it decides the fee.
  Truncating it would silently discard a pricing decision an operator wrote --
  the engine overriding the plan, which is the defect this module exists to
  prevent, and which the first draft of this fix was about to reintroduce.
