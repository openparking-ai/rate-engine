"""F64 -- a quote prices each way once, and asks nothing again per way or per pair.

The cheapest price always wins (F63), so every way of pricing a stay -- each
special and each time-based rate that qualifies -- is priced through the whole
pipeline, caps and all, and the lowest fee is charged. With N ways that is
N + 1 passes, and it is the rule itself: no way's fee is known until it has
been through every stage.

**What a review measured on top of that.** Each pass asked every rule again
whether it qualified, and then looked each rule up in the answer with
`rule in [...]`, which compares two rules field by field. Every pass also asked
every special that had NOT qualified for its line again. The work of a quote
grew with the cube of the ways: 800 any-day specials on a 90-day stay with a
daily and a weekly max took 26.9 s a stay, and 400 took about 3 s.

Now `quote` asks each rule once whether it qualifies (`engine._Qualified`) and
hands the answer to the gaps, the conflicts and every pass; a rule is found by
its id, which `load_plan` holds unique; a special that did not qualify is asked
for its line once. No limit was added: not on the rules a plan may hold, not on
the ways. What is left grows with the ways times the plan's rules.

What this file pins, counted rather than timed:

* every rule is asked once a quote whether it qualifies;
* no two rules are compared field by field;
* a special or time-based rate that qualifies is asked for its lines at most
  three times (its own pass, what it charges itself, and the receipt's pass if
  it wins), and one that did not qualify once;
* every cap runs once a pass, N + 1 times;

under both resolution modes, on 400 ways (300 specials and 100 time-based rates)
beside 100 specials that do not qualify. The counters stop the quote the moment
one goes over, so a quote doing the old work fails at once.

And timed: 400 qualifying specials and 400 that do not, on a 90-day stay with a
daily and a weekly max, are priced within `TIME_BUDGET_SECONDS`. On the machine
that measured this file it took about 0.3 s; the same stay took about 3 s with
the work repeated per pass, on 400 specials and none that did not qualify. The
budget stops the quote when it runs out, where the platform allows it.

`scripts/fail_controls.py` has each pass ask again and find the rule by
comparing whole rules, has a rule found by comparing whole rules alone, has a
special that did not qualify asked on every pass, and runs the time budget on
its own against the first of those, and requires red.
