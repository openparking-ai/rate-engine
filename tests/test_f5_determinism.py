"""F5 -- the same plan version and the same stay produce the same fee AND the same
breakdown, always.

Not "the same fee". The breakdown is the product, so a module whose explanation
drifts between two runs has an unstable product even where the number holds.

Two independent ways this could break, and both are tested because a guard on one
does not cover the other:

* **The wall clock.** Nothing in the pricing path may read `datetime.now()`. The
  test runs the same quote under two very different fake system clocks.
* **The timezone.** This is the realistic one and it is why the plan carries an
  IANA zone. An engine that read the SERVER's zone would price "exit by 17:00"
  differently in New York and in Frankfurt, and the same garage would bill two
  different amounts depending on which machine answered. `TZ` is moved under the
  engine's feet and the answer must not move.
