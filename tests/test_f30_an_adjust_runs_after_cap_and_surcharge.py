"""F30 -- an `adjust` effect applies to the fee AFTER the caps and the surcharges.

Gokhan: *"it is not only %. or increase or discount."* -- so a window's effect can
be an adjustment up or down, and *"on all"* is what it applies to. That places it,
and the placement is not a detail of this implementation.

**A percentage taken before the cap is a percentage of a number the customer is
not being charged.** The pipeline's own docstring already made this argument for
the cap and the surcharge: a cap that ran before the surcharge would cap a number
the customer is not paying, and a surcharge after the cap would survive it. An
adjustment is the same argument one step further along, so it runs LAST.

The stay below is chosen so the two orders disagree. A stay where they happened
to agree would let this file pass against an engine that ran the adjustment
first, which is the arrangement it exists to rule out.
