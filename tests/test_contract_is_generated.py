"""The contract's generated blocks must DERIVE what they assert.

GENERATION IS NOT VERIFICATION. Moving a sentence from a document into a template
does not stop it being hand-written: everywhere except the holes it is still
prose nobody checks, and a generated block asserts only what it derives from its
values. Anything else is a fixed string that no measurement can falsify.

So each test below plants a value that CONTRADICTS the document and requires the
document to change. A block that does not move under its own input is a hard-coded
sentence wearing a template's clothes, and this is the only thing that can tell
the two apart.
