"""F50 -- the driver pays the cheaper of the special and the time-based rate.

**Before U7g fix 1 a special that qualified REPLACED the time-based charge, even
when it cost more.** The gate's walk found it: a weekday car in at 08:00 and out
at 10:30 qualifies for an early bird at 9.00, and was charged 9.00, while the same
stay by the hour is 7.00. The owner's rule, 2026-10-11: "always cheaper goes
first"; asked on 2026-10-12 about exactly this stay, he answered "read your
question". Chat's reading, told to him: the driver always pays the cheapest way
the stay can be priced.

So under `cheapest_wins` the stay is priced through the WHOLE pipeline both ways
-- with the special, and by the time-based rate alone, caps and adjustments
included -- and charged the lower. A tie keeps the special. The breakdown says
which way was used and what the other would have charged.

**The fixture straddles the comparison on purpose.** One stay where the hourly
rate is cheaper (08:00 -> 10:30: 3.00 + 2 x 2.00 = 7.00 against 9.00) and one
where the special is (05:00 -> 18:00: 3.00 + 12 x 2.00 = 27.00 against 9.00). A
test holding only one of them passes one of the two plants.
