"""F16 -- a refusal that does not reach the caller is not a refusal.

Found by the outside-pass L3, by neither outside reviewer, and it is the item
that reached ordinary operator data. `money.NotMinorUnits` subclasses `TypeError`,
not `ValueError`, so `run_quote`'s `except (InvalidPlan, ValueError)` did not
catch it. A plain JSON float in a plan -- `8.0`, the shape `json.loads` produces
from any decimal an operator types -- escaped the function entirely. Over HTTP
the handler died mid-request and the client got `RemoteDisconnected`: no status,
no body, nothing to act on.

The float was ALWAYS correctly refused; F4 and F4b were never wrong. What was
wrong is that the refusal never became a RESPONSE. So this file tests the
boundary rather than the check: not "is a float rejected" but "what does the
caller receive".

**What is deliberately NOT done here: widening the clause to `TypeError`.** Every
genuine programming error in this module is a `TypeError` too, and catching them
all would answer an operator "your plan is invalid" for a bug in our own code --
a confident wrong answer, in the module whose standing acceptance is that it is
never wrong silently. The named class is caught; a real bug still crashes.
