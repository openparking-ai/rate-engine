"""F33 -- two caps leave the LOWER ceiling standing, in either order.

A cap is not a competing base. Two ceilings on one stay are not a contradiction
the owner has to settle -- they are two ceilings, and the lower one wins. That
falls out of applying them in sequence rather than being arranged, which is
exactly why CAP is a COMPOSING stage and not a resolving one.

**This is the property that had to exist before `weekly_max` could.**
`find_conflicts` refused whenever more than one rule qualified at ANY stage, so
the first plan carrying a daily AND a weekly cap would have refused every stay in
the garage. The bug was latent while no second CAP rule type existed; the rule
type is what detonates it.

**Order-independence is PROVEN, not asserted.** The totals after CAP must agree
whichever cap runs first -- and they are genuinely different computations: one
takes 44.00 down to 30.00 and then to 25.00; the other takes it to 25.00 and then
finds the daily cap already satisfied. The LINES differ; the total does not.
