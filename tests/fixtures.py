"""The fixture corpus, and the control that proves it exercises anything.

A FIXTURE IS PART OF THE MEASUREMENT. `vehicle-id`'s presence gate looked like it
worked partly because it was measured against a reference of flat grey with
nothing in it -- not a weak measurement, but not a measurement at all, producing
numbers that read as evidence. The equivalent failure here is a corpus of stays
that all sit on the same side of every threshold: the suite would go green,
`increment`'s repeat branch would never run, and nothing would say so.

So every axis below is READ OUT OF THE PLANS -- the actual constants the rules
branch on -- and `test_fixture_axes.py` asserts the corpus holds a case either
side of each. An axis that cannot reach its threshold is a broken axis, not a
safe threshold.
