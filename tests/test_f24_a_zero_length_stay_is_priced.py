"""F24 -- a zero-length stay pays the first period, and that is published.

Grok's outside review called this a defect: "a fee is returned for a stay of zero
duration ... the breakdown line claims a 'first period' that never occurred". The
L3 settled it as TRUE -- DECISION: it was decided in session on 2026-09-07 and
disclosed in the A1 brief, naming the divergence from the platform's older fee
code, which returns zero for the same stay.

But the L3 also found the decision had reached **no receipt and no published
surface** -- nothing in the contract, the README or any docstring told an
integrator that entry == exit is billed a full first period. A decision an
integrator cannot discover is indistinguishable from an accident, and the next
person to notice it files it as a bug, exactly as an outside reviewer just did.

**This file changes no behaviour.** It pins the decision so it cannot drift
silently, and its last test holds the published sentence to the code.
