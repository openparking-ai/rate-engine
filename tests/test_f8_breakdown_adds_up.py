"""F8 -- the fee is the sum of the breakdown's deltas, by construction.

The brief asked for a rule "whose reported line disagrees with its own effect".
Under the ledger that defect is not writable: a rule's only way to change the fee
IS to return a Line, so its line and its effect are the same object. That is the
point -- the guarantee is structural rather than a comparison between two copies
of one claim, and §6 is explicit that comparing two copies verifies nothing.

So the defect this file plants is the one that IS writable and that would
reintroduce the problem: a second route to the total. An engine that adjusts the
fee outside the ledger, or a rule that mutates something the ledger does not see.
The invariant in `engine._assert_ledger_is_the_fee` catches it, it lives in the
production path rather than only in tests, and `scripts/fail_controls.py` plants
exactly that second route and requires red.

The other half is registration-time: a rule that returns something which is not a
Line, or a Line carrying non-integer money, cannot enter the ledger at all.

#   effect with no entry  -- IMPOSSIBLE by construction. The applier is handed

#                            no return channel but Lines. Proven below.
#   entry with no effect  -- NOT A DEFECT. Zero-delta lines are required by the
#                            design; every "NOT applied" line is one.
#   a malformed return    -- THE REAL HOLE. It used to reach Ledger.add and die
#                            with an AttributeError naming neither rule nor type.
