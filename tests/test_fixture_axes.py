"""The control on the corpus itself: does it hold cases on BOTH sides of every axis?

A fixture is part of the measurement. This test enumerates the threshold
constants OUT OF THE REFERENCE PLAN -- not out of a list somebody typed -- and
requires the corpus to contain a stay strictly below and a stay at or above each
one. A corpus that could only ever exercise one branch would make the whole suite
green while measuring half of it, and nothing else here would notice.
