"""F59 -- a daily max caps each calendar day on its own, and a weekly max each week.

Gokhan, 2026-10-16 (OP-PYTHON-110, FR FO-H2): the daily max is per calendar
day. Split the stay at the garage's local midnight and cap each day by itself;
a day the stay touches for zero minutes adds nothing. Until this, a cap took
the WHOLE stay's charge down to the max times the days it touched, so fifteen
minutes past midnight unlocked a second full day's cap for the fifteen hours
before it.

$8 the first hour and $4 an hour after, $30 a day, New York, as in F56:

* Monday 09:00 to Tuesday 00:15 is 30.00 for Monday's 64.00 and 4.00 for
  Tuesday's fifteen minutes -- the stay's sixteenth hour. 34.00, not 60.00.
* The rate does not start again at midnight: Tuesday's fifteen minutes are a
  repeat hour at 4.00, not a new first hour at 8.00 (that would be 38.00).
* A period is charged on the day it STARTS. The minute a car enters a period it
  owes all of it, which is what `ceil` means; an hour from 23:30 to 00:30 is
  Monday's.
* A 23- or 25-hour day is one day: the cut is at local midnight, never 24 hours
  after the last one.
* A weekly max caps each week the same way -- by the plan's own week, from the
  day it names -- after the daily max for each of its days.
* A flat special is one price for the whole stay. There is no day it was
  charged in, so it is capped as before: at the max times the days the car is
  in. Whether the owner wants a multi-day flat special split by the day is a
  question this file does not answer; it pins what ships.

The caps learn how the time was charged from the engine (`charged_by`, the
`told_the_base` trait), and the engine checks that what the base says it charged
is what its lines charged, on every quote.

`scripts/fail_controls.py` puts back the whole-stay cap, charges every day from
entry, makes a day 24 hours long, lets a week ignore the daily max, allows a
week the whole weekly max, splits a flat price by the day, tells the caps the
wrong base, and turns the ledger check off, and requires this file to go red
each time.
